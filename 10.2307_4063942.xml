          <text>STUDIES IN MALAYAN, MELANESIAN AND AUSTRALIAN TETTIGONIIDAE (ORTHOPTERA). BY MORGAN HEBARD. In 1920 the author published a first paper, dealing with that part of the collections here treated which covered the section be- longing to the family Mantidae.' Though the present paper is considerably larger, the number ot species of Tettigoniidae known from the regions under consideration is very much greater and, as a result, the present work is not intended to be in any way monographic. A number of difficulties have been cleared up and the proper sequence of species in some places we feel is now defined. Much work remains to be done, and the Tettigoniidae of these regions must be monographed before the student will be able to determine material in small series. The literature on the group is too vast and scattered to be accessible, unless a great amount of preliminary work has been done; and reference to a large and comprehensive library is a constant necessity. In order to aid in locating the literature, particularly that subsequent to Kirby's Catalogue, numerous references have been given in the present study. All of the material here recorded, unless otherwise stated, is in the author's collection at THE ACADEMY OF NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA, with the exception of duplicate specimens from Mr. C. F. Baker, representing species not in his collection; such Avill be forwarded to him whenever desired. Five hundred and thirty-one specimens are recorded, representing ninety-four genera and one hundred and ninety-one species, of which fourteen genera, *one subgenus, seventy-three species, and one subspecies, are new. Unfortunately, the great majority of species are represented by but one or two specimens. We have found that Wallace's line separates quite as large a percentage of species of Tettigoniidae as of the Mantidae, clearly delimiting the Malayan from the Melanesian fauna.1 Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., 1920, pp. 14 to 82.(121) </text>

          <text>122 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Vol. LXXIV Accurate and full deseriptions of the genitalia have been found of the greatest importance. Failure by Brunner and Redtenbacher to deseribe these parts adequately constitutes one of the most serious defects in their monographs. The accuracy and finish shown in the accompanying figures, particularly of the Listroscelid genitalia, are due to the exceptional skill of Miss Mary B. Lane. We are deeply indebted to her for the unusual effort which was required in reproducing these indeseribably intricate parts. We have given the number of spines on the ventral femoral margins for many species, not because we believe the exact number to be diagnostic for any species, but because each species will probably be found to have a definite range in number and develop- ment2 of such spines, often differing from that of its nearest re- latives. In some groups we have already found these spines to be decidedly variable in certain species, quite constant in others. In our studies of the South American species of the genus Conocephalus, where we had large series of many species, the range in a species of such spines was found to constitute a valuable aid.

The treatment, by Brunner, of material from Assam, as the synonymous annulata,3 is much more satisfactory than Walker's diagnosis. Elimaea annamensis new species. Plate XI, figures 1 and 2. This relatively large species is of a general pale green coloration, excepting the dorsal surface of the head, pronotum and tegmina, which is uniform dark reddish brown, and the antennae, which are of a similar dark color ventrad, slightly paler dorsad and show a few, very small and widely separated, pale annuli distad. It is very closely related to E. schmidti Krausze, deseribed from the same locality.4 It differs from that species in having the occiput and pronotal disk dark, in the shorter pronotum, more elongate tegmina and decidedly more elongate limbs. Six species have been described as members of the genus Elimaea2 Highly specialized spines occur on the ventral femioral margins in the Pseudophyllid genus Aforsimus and its allies. 3 Monogr. der Phaneropteriden, p. 92, pl. 1, figs. 10, a to d, (1878). 4Ins.-B?rse, XX, p. 2, (1903). </text>

We are told by Dohrn5 that one of the former's species is referable to Hemielimaea and another to Ducetia. We believe, however, that the numerical abundance of the species of Elimaea in Indo-China is very large. In Brunner's key6 the species runs nearest to appendiculata Brunner. The insect is large, with comparatively broad tegmina for the genus, though not as large or with tegmina as broad as in E. insignis (Walker). TYPE: &amp;; Phuc-Son, Annam. November to December.

Brunner, indicated that his E. femorata, described from Borneo, might represent that species. After careful comparison of the original descriptions, we follow Dohrn who, in 1906, placed femorata in synonymy under caricifolia. The present insect differs in the generally smaller size, with tegmina much narrower. Compared with the female, deseribed by Brunner as femorata, further decided difference is found in the median vein of the tegmina, which does not branch mesad, the tegmina which do not widen distad and the median femora which are not carinate dorsad.9 TYPE: 9; Labuan, British North Borneo.

The present is a medium large species, in life probably of a pale green coloration, the lateral margins of the pronotal disk outlined in a series of brown flecks, the tegmina with brown flecks, the cephalic and median femora proximo-externally splotched and flecked with brown and the median and caudal tibiae with a proximo-external fleck of the same color.12 The male subgenital plate is forked to near its base and divided into two strongly recurved, almost flagellate, processes, which proximad are embraced by the cerci. TYPE: e; Davao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 785.] Size and form medium for the genus. Cephalic femora rather strongly compressed and curved in a Phasmoid manner, lamellate dorsad except in immediate proximal portion, this formed by the external margin which longitudinally shows a very weak con- vexity. Cephalic coxae each armed with a very small spine. Foramen of cephalic tibiae conchate, deplanate dorsad and strongly flattened laterad. Face to clypeal suture somewhat swollen, bounded on each side by a broadly and shallowly concave area. Tegmina with median vein branching mesad, this branch sending two branches to the sutural margin distad. Pronotal disk with surface flattened, lateral margins very broadly and evenly concave.

Tegmina and wings fully developed, the former with greatest width de-from a female from Java (Hist. Nat. fns., Orth., p. 4;18, (1839).) Dohrn, recog- nizing this difference, has named the species brunneri and has described very briefly the male sex. That sex is seen to differ from the male of bakeri in having the supra-anal plate sharply acute distad, the cerci apparently more simple and not embracing the subgenital plate (Stett. Ent. Zeit., LXVII, p. 348, (1906).) Unfortunately Karny overlooked this and has again renamed the species brunneri (Zool. Mededeel. Rijks Mus. Nat. Hist. Leiden, V, p. 183, (1920).) It would appear that Haan, deseribing a Javanese male as parumnpunctata Serville, really had that species (Verh. Nat. Gesch. Nederl. overzee. bezitt., Zool., Ins., p. 192. (1842).) If this is true, parumpunctata is a species belonging to that section of the genus in which the pronotal disk is more decidedly constrieted and the tegmina narrower. 1: To this species, E. puncticosta Bolivar (Asoc. Espanola Prog. Cienc., Sec. 4a, Cien. Nat., Junio, p. 8, (1913)) is apparently also related, differing, however, in a number of important features. It is unfortunate that that author chose to deseribe as new an imperfeet female of this genus which contains so very many species and mriore unfortunate that such important measurements as the pronotal width, proportions of its lateral lobes and tegminal width were not given. </text>

We do not agree with Dohrn in considering roseo-alata a synonym of parumpunctata (Serville). The following charaeters are given for the hitherto undescribed male sex. Tegmina widest meso-proximad, narrowing strongly mesad, then very slightly to the broadly rounded apex; anal field dark brown, with veinlets light brown; discoidal field light brown with very numerous minute flecks of dark brown toward anal vein and larger (twenty or more) flecks mesad in areolae of discoidal field. Wings with veins pink and intervening portions hyaline and strongly (pink and green) iridescent. Dorsal surface of ab- domen pink. Tibiae suffused distad. Supra-anal plate nearly twice as long as proximal width, lateral margins weakly convergent proximad, then nearly parallel, rounding into the truncate apex. Cerci cylindrical, strongly curved inward, particularly distad, there tapering sharply off into a long, sharp, slightly curved, apical spine. Subgenital plate elongate, tapering strongly proximad, the long and narrow shaft beyond with lateral margins very weakly concave, the apex itself rather deeply cleft; the two portions thus formed projecting latero-distad and acute-angulate. Length of body 17, length of pronotum 4.3, least width of pro- notum 1.3, greatest (caudal) width of pronotum 2.7, length of tegmen 30, greatest (meso-proximal) width of tegmen 6.4, least (distal) width of tegmen 3.8, length of cephalic femur 8, length of caudal femur 21.8 mm. Miroflia aeta new species. Plate XI, figures 12 and 13. This insect is readily distinguished from the Javanese genotype, carinata, by its smaller size, weak though distinct limb spination and, in the male sex, the strikingly distinctive genitalic special- ization.14 A full generic diagnosis has been given by Brunner.1514 It is very possible that the female recorded by Karny as M. carinata (Haan), from Mount Makiling, Luzon, Philippine Islands, represents this species (Philip- pine Jour. Sci., XVIII, p. 613, (1921).) 15 Monogr. der Phaneropteriden, p. 106 and pl. 1, figs. a to c, (1875). </text>

Nearest actual agreement, however, is with Himerta, the male genitalia being similar in type, but Prohimerta differs in the weakly sulcate vertex, lateral lobes of pronotum which are not longer than high, much larger size, much longer and broader tegmina (with branches of the median vein strongly oblique, as in the genus Phaula Brunner) and spination of the cephalic tibiae. Though the dorsal margins of the cephalic tibiae bear a few spines, the sudden constriction beyond the auditory foramina and the male genitalic development show the position of the genus to be in the Group Letanae and not in the Group Ducetiae. GENOTYPE.-Prohimerta annamensis new species. Cephalic coxae unarmed. Pronotum with disk flattened and caudal margin broadly convex, the lateral lobes roundly inserted but with angulation distinet, humeral sinus distinct. Vertex weakly sulcate and declivent to the rounded, horizontal distal extremity, which is separated by a considerable gap from the small, erect, rounded frontal fastigium. Male subgenital plate without styles, deeply. cleft, with the fingers thus formed nearly parallel. Cephalic tibiae with apert auditory foramina, these members there stout but suddenly constrieted beyond; suleate dorsad bearing a proximo-external, meso-distal-external and on each side a distal very small spine. Pronotum and limbs, except caudal tibiae, rather thickly supplied with very small, stiff, short, ereet hairs. Tegmina decidedly wider than pronotal length with branches of median veim strongly oblique. Prosternum unarmed. Mesosternum weakly lobate, metasternum sublobate. Prohimerta annamensis new species. Plate XI, figures 17, 18 and 19. This is a striking species, due to the conspicuous pale annuli of the dark antennae, the dotted tegmina and dark cephalic feet and caudal tibiae.

Supra-anal plate very small, triangularly convex, deflexed between the cercal bases. Cercus with base small, stout conical, its apex produced inward in a sharp, slender blade nearly twice the length of the shaft, direeted at right-angles to the shaft; this blade is longitudinally tri-lamellate and curves evenly and weakly to its sharp apex. Subgenital plate strongly narrowing at base, the distal portion very deeply and narrowly cleft and extending caudad of the cerci; the fingers thus formed stout, with external surface moderately supplied with short hairs and internal surface very thickly supplied with very short, erect hairs. General coloration of tegmina and exposed portions of wings light green (in life probably ineluding body and limbs), faded to yellowish brown over greater part of other portions. Head with vertex pinkish and two postocular suffusions of pinkish brown on each side. Antennae beautifully annulate, each of these annuli first briefly blackish brown, then fading over a considerable space to pinkish brown, terminated by a brief buffy area; these annuli become more elongate distad in strongly increasing ratio. Teg- mina green, stridulating field pinkish brown, caudad of it a paler area and the pinkish brown narrowing beyond along the sutural margin and disappearing mesad; intervals between veins minutely flecked with brown, these flecks. clustering to form distinet small patches at considerable intervals mesad between the veins.

The subgenital plate is rather broadly truncate and sub-bilobate distad. Scambophyllum albomarginatum new species. Plate XII, figure 1. This species is related to the Sumatran S. sanguineolentum (Westwood). Females before us differ from females of that species in the narrower tegmina, which narrow gradually distad from the median point, with meso-proximal concavity of the costal margin decidely less and in the flattened subsuleate dorsal surface of the cephalic femora. Difference in coloration is shown by the broad white ventral margins of the pronotal lateral lobes and the narrow white costal margins of the tegmina. TYPE: 9: Labuan, British North Borneo. [Hebard Collection, Type no. 805.] Vertex represented by a small rounded, subsulcate projection, not extending as far cephalad and a very brief distance above the more narrowly rounded facial fastigium. Pronotum short, disk rounding broadly into lateral lobes, broader than long, with transverse sulci decided, its caudal margin broadly convex and showing faint angulation mesad; lateral lobes with ventral margin weakly oblique and very broadly convex (straight in paratype), caudal margin weakly oblique to the broad and weakly indicated humeral sinus. Tegmina very narrowly elongate-oval, narrowing gradually from the median point to the broadly rounded apex, the costal margin showing a broad and weak concavity meso- proximad; mediastine vein very weak, but as heavy as the more than usually heavy transverse veins; discoidal vein curving to costal margin at end of its proximal three-fifths; median vein straight to costal margin near apex, branching at base of distal curvature of discoidal vein, this branch nearly longitudinal and running to apex; ulnar vein with a proximal branch running to median vein, this branch from that point running parallel to ulnar vein to opposite branch of median vein, there ceasing; the ulnar vein itself running nearly parallel to the median vein and branch. Wings Gryllacroid, parachute -like, not full and thus apparently showing incipient atrophy. Ovipositor strongly re- curved at base, broad, broadly rounded at apex, disk distad sca- brous, dorsal margin in distal portion and ventral margin toward apex with heavy triangular teeth. Subgenital plate triangular with broad truncate apex rounded, chitinous only in narrow mar- ginal portions. Genicular lobes and ventral margins of femora unarmed.

Antennae with proximal joints marked with blackish, in remaining portions black with light buif, widely spaced annuli, of which the second is much the largest, occupying three j oints. Pronotum biscay green, the lateral lobes very broadly margined ventrad with cream color, this showing traces of mars brown along its inner margin. Tegmina serpentine green with countless microscopic flecks of dark vinaceous (the intervals between the very closely packed veinlets), costal margin white, with a slightly narrower internal border of dark vinaceous, sutural margin more broadly black between the brown veins, this occupying all of the anal field. Wings apricot buff, the anterior field suffused with acajou red and the transverse veins of the radiate field strongly defined in that color. Abdomen washed with acajou red dorsad.

This small immature individual is dark brown, beautifully marked with buif and white. There is no question that it represents the genus, but we can not say with certainty the same for the specific determination. One species only, however, has been recorded from Sumatra. Scambophyllum sandakanae new species. Plate XII, figures 2, 3 and 4. The unicolorous wings and lateral margins of pronotal disk defined by dark markings are striking features of difference in this insect. In addition, though the emargination of the costal margins of the tegmina is more sudden even than in 8. sanguineolentum (Westwood), these organs taper more strongly distad even than in 8. albomarginatum here described, with venation more delicate and different in several important respects. </text>

The bluntly serrate dorsal lamella of the distal arm is chitinous and dark, in striking contrast to the pale shaft.16 Rev. Suisse Zool., pl. IX, fig. 9, (1898). </text>

Casigneta lamellosa Brunner, Verh. Zool-bot. Ges. Wien, XLI, p. 77. [c?, Celebes.] Obi Island, Moluccas, 2 9. Without males we are unable to determine these specimens with certainty. Brunner has described lamellosa from the male genitalia alone, but the measurements show it to be a species with more slender tegmina than cochleata. As the present specimens agree in this respect, we have assigned them accordingly. In all other features, except those of proportion, they are similar to the Amboina female here recorded as cochleata. In these females as well as in the specimen of cochleata, the teg- mina have the veinlets of the distal section of the enlarged portion of the anal field buffy, with minute intervals dark- brown. From there to the apex the sutural margin has the minute spaces between the green veinlets similarly dark brown. These latter markings are so fine that they are scarcely distinguishable to the naked eye.

The present material proves conclusively the synonymy indi- cated above, caused by Brunner's failure to associate the sexes of this species. The anal tergite of the female has not been described.

It agrees closely with that sex of E. tenera Brunner. In addition to having the forking of the branch of the median vein more distal in position, the present female has the anal tergite produced in a pair of very slender, slightly decurved and divergent, straight processes, above the shield-shaped supra- anal plate, these processes more slender and elongate and more widely separated than in tenera.

Known from a unique female, this sex differs from any pre- viously described female of the genus, except E. manillensis Pietet,22 in the brevity of the ovipositor. From that insect the present differs in the smaller size and shorter pronotum, with lateral lobes no deeper than wide.20 It appears very possible that Brunner's E. modesta, deseribed from the Philippines, will prove to be a synonymn of manillensis. Pictet deseribes the ovipositor of that species as short, but does not give the length. </text>

Tegmina and wings fully developed. Tegmina with median vein branching a brief distance before its median point, this branch forking nearly at its median point, these veins running longitudinally and showing only weak obliquitv; near its extremity the median vein sends one or two, poorly defined, branches to the sutural margin and apex. Anal tergite simple, triangularly emarginate above the small, short, shield-shaped supra-anal plate. Ovipositor short for the genus, dorsal margin strongly concave proximad, ventral margin evenly convex to the acute apex; dorsal and ven-tral margins distinetly serrulate, surface of dorsal valves to near proximal portion with minute nodules, the other oortions of the lateral surfaces of the valves with even smaller, very minute nodules. The ovipositor is much shorter and more strongly curved, with apex more acute than in E. tenera Brunner.

In other features these species appear to agree very closely, except that in serraticauda the tegmina are slightly wider, with first branch of the median vein forking mesad. Though agreeing closely in general appearance with the female, here described as E. makilingae, the present male differs con- spicuously in the pronotal lateral lobes, which are distinetly higher than wide and in the shorter limbs. TYPE: c; Puerto Princesa, Palawan, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 794.] Vertex as described for makilingae. Pronotum with lateral lobes distinctly higher than wide. Tegmina with median vein branching at about end of its proximal two-fifths, this branch forking at nearly its median point, these veins running longitudinally and showing very weak obliquity; near its distal extremity the median vein sends another poorly defined branch to the apex.2' Anal tergite produced mesad in two slender, narrowly separated, pro- cesses which are parallel proximad and converge weakly distad, with delicate, lamellate, rounded apices vertical. Below this tergite and above the cerci is a small projection bearing a small, straight, cylindrical projection, with apex rounded, directed caudad. Cercus cylindrical, tapering, curved evenly inward distad to the acute apex. Subgenital plate trough shaped, straight- produced proximad and narrowly V-emarginate in distal portion of this section, the two distal portions thus formed suddenly and strongly recurved, directed dorso-cephalad, each straight and gradually tapering, with internal margin armed with a regular row of small, stout teeth. Limbs as described for makilingae&gt; except that they are decidedly shorter. Genicular lobes of femora all rounded and unarmed, except the internal of the caudal femora which are unispinose. Ventral femoral margins armed as follows. Cephalic internal 4 and 4, cephalic external 0, median internal 0, median external 2 and 3, caudal internal 2 and 3, caudal external 1 and 2. The unique type is badly discolored but shows the entire proximal portions of the tegminal stridulating field, to and including the stridulating vein, very dark brown. The other portions were apparently immaculate, light green in life.21 The venation of the sinistral tegmen is distorted in this specimen, the ulnar fusing with the first branch of the median vein, that branch forking twice insteaci of once, meso-proximad and meso-distad. </text>

The auditory foramina of the cephalic tibiae are conchate on both sides in this genus and, for this reason alone, it had been assigned a position in the Group Anaulocomerae.

This interesting species is known from the deseribed pair. Phaula galeata new species. Plate XIII, figures 8 and 9. This species belongs to the second section of the genus, as recognized by Brunner, in which the first branch of the median vein of the tegmina is forked. This should be noted as a feature of convergence toward the type characteristic of the genus Elbenia. It would appear probable that in this section of the genus several distinct generic units are involved and the present species may require generic separation when the group is comprehensively studied. At the present time insufficient material is at hand for this to be accomplished, though we feel justified in separating, on page 150, one of the units included by Brunner. The remarkably crested and undivided anal tergite of the male, readily separates it from males of the species of apparently nearest affinity, the Bornean P. gracilis Brunner. TYPE: e, Davao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 796.] Vertex narrowly V-shaped and sulcate to near apex, the lateral margins parallel in distal portion as in P. phaneropteroides Brunner. Pronotum with surface smooth, the lateral lobes very slightly wider than deep. Tegmina and wings fully developed. Tegmina with costal margin of stridulating area convex, not produced at stridulating vein; median vein with first branch forked slightly beyond median point and weakly oblique, the median vein with a second undivided oblique branch distad; ulnar vein reaching sutural margin at end of its proximal two-thirds. Anal tergite produced mesad in a vertical lobe, this lobe higher than long, its dorsal and ventral margians moderately divergent to its broadly convex distal margin, the dorso-distal angle bluntly rounded, the ventro-distal angle delicately lipped. Cercus cylindrical, tapered and curving evenly inward to the irregularly enlarged apex, which is produced in a long, weakly sigmoid tooth. These organs reach to the base of the produced lobe of the anal tergite. Subgenital plate small, triangular, medio-longitudinally cleft to its kase. This plate suggests the usual triangular type found in females rather than the type developed in males of any species we can recall. Ventral femoral margins armed with very small spines as follows. Cephalic internal 5, cephalic external 0, median internal 0 and 1, median external 6 and 7, caudal internal 3 and 5, caudal external 7 and 7. </text>

General coloration immac- ulate, apparently pale green in life, except that the stridulating area is suffused and the sutural margin very narrowly blackish brown to its extremity. Occiput, genae, pronotum and femora mieroscopically dotted with hydrangea red; these dots, however, fewer and averaging larger than in P. luzonica, here described.

STICTOPHAlLA new genus This genus is erected to include Phaneropterca trichopus Haan,24 Phaula spinoso-laminata, Phaula chlorotica Brunner and the three species described in the present paper. GENOTYPE.-Stictophaula bakeri new species. It is closely related to the genus Phaula, agreeing in all char- acters of group or higher importance. It differs in the very strongly declivent vertex, weaker tegminal venation, with veinlets fully as multitudinous, but with veins of discoidal field and cross-veins irregularly flexuous, sutural margin of male stridulating area produced at stridulating vein, cephalic femora with internal audi- tory foramen conchate,2 simple male anal tergite, supra-anal plate and cerci and ovipositor of female with margins entirely unarmed, the dorsal valves weakly concave on their ventral margins distad, into which fit the apices of the ventral valves. The tegminal surfaces are weakly convex and the character of their venation gives to individuals of this genus a general facies, contrasting with the species of Phaula much as does that of the species of the North American genus Anblycorypha when compared with the North American genus Phaneroptera.26 Stictophaula bakeri new species. Plate XIII, figures 10, 11 and 12. This inseet is closely related to 8. spinoso-laminata (Brunner). The apparent features of difference are the minutely but thickly pink-speckled pronotum, abdomen and median and caudal femora;24Under this name chlorotica has been placed as a synonym by Dohrn. We do not believe that this synonymy can be recognized until material from Java and Singapore can be compared. 25 Not flattened conehate as in the species of Phaula. 26 Caudell has recently fixed the genotype of Phaneroptera as curvicauda (De Geer). As this is the first valid designation, Scudderia falls as a synonym of Phaneroptera, while the Old World genus, previously recognized as Phaner- optera, is renamed Anerota by Caudell (Jour. Washington Acad. Sci., XI p. 488, (1921).) </text>

TYPE: dl; Singapore, British Straits Settlements. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 797.] Vertex narrowly V-shaped and sulcate to near apex. Maxillary palpi exceedingly elongate and slender, fourth joint half as long as third and one-third as long as fifth. Pronotum with surface smooth, disk defined from lateral lobes by the broadly rounded lateral margins, lateral lobes decidedly deeper than wide, with humeral sinus deep. Tegmina and wings fully developed, the delicate but close veinulation of the former giving them somewhat the appearance of ground-glass; tegmina with ulnar vein reaching sutural margin slightly beyond end of its proximal two-thirds, median vein branching distinetly before median point, two strongly oblique and irregular branches of the median vein distad. Supra- anal plate strongly deflexed, short, slightly broader than long, triangular, with lateral margins broadly convex. Anal tergite truncate distad. Cercus elongate, slender, weakly and evenly curved inward, tapering gradually to its acute apex. Subgenital plate narrowing proximad, distal portion V-emarginate, the lateral portions thus formed narrowly triangular with apices rounded, their internal margins each with a minute rectangular offset mesad.

Cephalic internal 8, cephalic external 0, median internal 0, median external 8 and 9, caudal internal 6 and 7, caudal external 5 and 7. Tegmina translucent light grape green, body and limbs in life apparently of this color. Maxillary palpi immaculate. Pronotum, abdomen, median and caudal femora minutely and thickly dotted with hydrangea red. Cephalic femora very thickly dotted with black, with five opaque buffy areas on dorsal surface, spines of these members black. Cephalic tibiae with a few black dots prox- imad, particularly dorsad on the auditory foramina. Tegmina, in areolae on each side of the ulnar vein with a few of the minute intervals between the veinlets mesad black, six or seven cross- veins near median vein gathering knots of veinlets near their bases, which are buffy; stridulating field with intervals between veinlets embrowned latero-proximad and mesad, sutural margin beyond very narrowly darkened, with veins brown and intervals between veinlets blackish, to apex.27 In this feature alone is closer agreement with S. chlorotica (Brunner) shown </text>

The type is unique. Stictophaula quadridens new species. Plate XIII, figure 13. Nearest the Javan S. spinoso-laminata (Brunner), the male of this inseet may be quickly distinguished by the subgenital plate, which is produced distad in two slenderly acute-conical projections, between the bases of which are two sharp, straight teeth, one-third as long. Unlike that species and S. bakeri here described, the prese.it insect has the pronotum and limbs immaculate. The tegmina have the stridulating field more extensively suffused with blackish browni than in bakeri, but with brown areolae along the sutural margin much less Conspicuous. The tegminal venation is much as in bakeri, differing as described below. TYPE: c; Singapore, British Straits Settlements. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 854.] Agrees with the deseription of bakeri in all details except the following.

Plate XIII, figures 14 and 15. Known form a unique female, the present species is seen to agree closely with S. spinoso-laminata (Brunner) and 8. bakeri here described, except for its decidedly smaller size. In tegminal venation it agrees with spinoso-laminata in having the median vein with a single branch beyond its forked first branch, while it appears also to agree closely with that species in coloration. We believe that the male genitalia will show signal differentiation. TYPE: 9; Singapore, British Straits Settlements. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 798.] Size small for the genus. Vertex narrowly V-shaped and suleate to near apex. Maxillary palpi exceedingly elongate and slender, fourth joint slightly over half as long as third, slightly over one- third as long as fifth. Pronotum with surface smooth, disk round- ing broadly into lateral lobes, these very slightly higher than wide, with humeral sinus deep. Tegmina and wings fully developed, the tegminal structure and venation as described for bakeri except that the median vein has but a single strongly oblique and irregular branch beyond the forked first branch. Ovipositor slightly longer than pronotum, its structure as characteristic of the genus. Sub- genital plate very short, triangular. Genicular lobes unarmed except those of the caudal femora, the internal of those portions each with a large and very minute spine, the external of those portions unispinose. Ventral femoral margins armed with minute spines as follows. Cephalic internal 7 and 9, cephalic external 0, median internal 0, median external 8, caudal internal 4 and 6, caudal external 8 and 9.

The specimen from Amboina agrees fully with Brunner's de- seription in form of the male cerci. In the Obi male the minute subapical internal tooth is absent from the cerci. The literature on this genus is extremely unsatisfactory and without more material we cannot solve the problems which at present confront the student. It would appear very probable that melanonota St?l is a synonym of ensis (Haan), as is also marginata Fritze, in Karl.29 Until a complete revision of the genus is accomplished we can only state that in the material before us two distinet species are represented, one unquestionably brunneri of Karny, the other melanonota of St?l.

In general appearance, however, the insect strongly suggests a small,- uniformly colored species of the genus Psyra. GENOTYPE.-PPseudopsyra mirabilis new species. Size medium for the group, form much as in the genus Psyra. Head with eyes extremely prominent, bead-like. Vertex very small, in dorsal aspect appearing only as a smooth narrowing of the occiput cephalad without suleation, in cephalic aspect with face nearly vertical, narrowly and irregularly suleate to ventral margin, where it is briefly separated from the facial fastigium, its lateral surfaces fully occupied by the large lateral ocelli. Pronotum much as in Psyra, surface smooth, lateral lobes with length equal to width and with humeral sinus decided. Tegmina and wings fully de- veloped, the former with venation much as in Psyra. Tegmina with mediastine vein distinct, median vein sending a forked branch and two or three distal branches obliquely across the discoidal field. Mesosternum with lobes small, triangular with apices rounded, metasternum with lobes much larger and more rounded. Male genitalia very highly specialized, the subgenital plate bearing ex- tremely elongate styles. Femora supplied with minute spines on the usual margins for the group, genicular lobes bispinose. Ce- phalic tibiae with auditory foramina internally conchate, externally apert; dorsal surface weakly suleate, its internal margin with three and one distal, small spines. Pseudopsyra mirabilis new species. Plate XIII, figures 16 and 17. This plainly colored species shows one of the highest types of male genitalic specialization we have encountered, such occurring not only in the ultimate tergite but in the cerci and subgenital plate a-s well.

This species is closely related to H. javanica Brunner, differing in the tegmina which are obscurely maculate and which, in the females, narrow less evenly distad and are, in consequence, broader meso-distad. A short, suffused postocular line of brown is found on each side of the head, this continued as a short line of the same color along the lateral margins of the pronotal disk at its cephalic margin. Brunner does not niention the stridulating area of the tegmina in the male type. In the male before us this area is occupied by a close network of veinlets, the stridulating vein itself subobsolete with no distinct convexity at the costal margin. This appears to agree closely with the type deseribed for the male of H. javanica Brunner.

Holochlora maxima new species. Plate XII, figure 5; plate XIV, figure 3. This inseet, known from a single female, is closely related to H. fusco-spinosa Brunner. It differs in the larger size, pale im- maculate femoral spines and more deeply. cleft apex of the sub- genital plate. The tegmina are similar but more heavily maculate, this being, however, probably no stronger than in maximum in- tensive individuals of that species. </text>

          <text>1922] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 159From the female sex of H. javanica Brunner it differs in all the features given here under fusco-spinosa to distinguish females of that species. TYPE: 9; Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 701.] Size very large, form robust. Tegmina tapering very gradually distad to meso-distal point, thence tapering strongly to the rather broadly rounded apex. Ovipositor as charaeteristic of the genus; proximal plica of dorsal valves acute dorsad but rounded ventrad, distance from base of ovipositor to end of plica slightly less than half that to apex of ovipositor. Subgenital plate elongate, medio- longitudinally carinate, lateral margins concave convergent to apex, which is V-emarginate a distance equal to the width of one of the two lateral, rounded apices thus formed. This emargination is distinctly larger than in fusco-spinosa. General coloration yellowish, probably green in life. Head with a subobsolete postocular fleck of brown, which is continued very briefly on the lateral margin of the pronotal disk at the cephalic margin as a short linear suffusion. Tegmina with (six and seven) dark brown spots in proximal two-thirds of discoidal field near median vein and with much weaker but similar spots near ulnar vein toward the sutural margin and in areas between the ulnar and branches of the median vein.31 Limbs immaculate, except that the last joint of the caudal tarsi is dark brown to near its base; spines darkened only at their very tips. Abdomen with a large blackish blotch laterad on penultimate tergite. Ovipositor with dorsal portion of plica darkened, ovipositor valves embrowned except mesad toward base,-becoming very dark distad. Length of body 33.5, length of pronotum 9, caudal width oI pronotal disk 6.7, length of tegmen 63.9, greatest width of tegmen 17.8, meso-distal width of tegmen 15.8, length of cephalic femur 8.3, length of caudal femur 35.3, length of ovipositor 11 mm.

          <text>160 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Vol. LXXIVEULOPHOPHYLLUM new genus The single species, to include which the present genus is proposed, is one of the most distinetive of the Orthoptera. This insect runs to the Group Holochlorae, nearest the genus Liotrachela, from which it is widely separated by features of the vertex, pronotum, tegmina, limbs and ovipositor. In the form and venation of the tegmina widest differentiation from any other known katydid is found. GENOTYPE.-Eulophophyllum thaumasium new species. Head deep, oceiput convex with vertex curving and very strongly declivent to the facial fastigium, medio-longitudinally suleate. Eyes elongate, vertical, not projecting strongly for the Group and very weakly so laterad. Pronotum short, surface of disk weakly concave with lateral margins raised in a rounded ridge; lateral lobes vertical, with width approximating depth, ventro-caudal portion decidedly produced caudad and broadly rounded. Teg- mina very broad; costal margin nearly straight, very weakly and evenly convex; sutural margin broadly and evenly convex proximad, becoming strongly convex distad, to the rather sharply rounded apex at the costal margin. Tegmina with discoidal vein weakly and evenly curved to apex, sending seven straight and moderately oblique veins to the costal margin, which are parallel to and as heavy as the mediastine vein; median vein with two weak distal branches which curve distad in brief proximal portion, then recurve and run back to the sutural margin as weakly curved veins parallel to the similar branches of the ulnar vein. Ulnar vein separated a brief distance from the median vein, running to end of proximal three-fifths of tegmen, with three branches (the last actually the recurved portion of the ulnar vein itself) which recurve sharply and run back to the sutural margin as weakly curved, parallel and equally separated veins. The branches of these tegminal veins are all subparallel with intervening sections of the tegminal surface weakly coneave. Wings with interealated triangle apical and large. Mesosternal and metasternal lobes small, rounded quad- rate. Ovipositor large, broad to the rounded apex, dorsal margin denticulate to near base, ventral margin denticulate distad; basal plica present, but weakly defined and rounded. Female subgenital plate simple. Cephalic coxae spined. Femora moderately heavy. Cephalic tibiae with dorsal surface flattened, subsuleate, bearing on its internal margin a proximal and an apical spine; auditory foramina flattened conchate internally, apert externally. Eulophophyllum thaumasium new species. Plate XII, figures 6 and 7. The remarkable tegmina, with costal margin nearly straight and sutural margin strongly convex distad, give to the organs of flight, when these are spread, a strongly Lepidopteroid contour. </text>

[Hebard Collection, Type no. 802.] The following features are noteworthy, in addition to those given in the generic diagnosis. Antennae, beyond first two joints, exceedingly slender. Pro- notal disk with cephalic margin weakly concave and caudal margin broadly convex, lateral margins straight and moderately divergent caudad. Ultimate tergite with a small, transverse, rectangular impressed area above the median portion of the supra-anal plate; the latter broader than long, simple, triangular. Lateral surfaces of ovipositor showing very faint, delicate, transverse striation in distal portions. Subgenital plate with lateral portion reflexed, roughly triangular, the weakly concave lateral margins converging to the rather broadly convex apex. Ventral femoral margins specialized as indicated and armed with the following spines. Cephalic internal (lamellate) 6 and 6, cephalic external 0 and 1, median internal 0, median external (lamellate) 6 and 7, caudal internal 3, caudal external 6. General coloration ochraceous buff, the following portions baryta yellow; a vertical subocullar line, a very faint postocular line, the broad lateral margins of the pronotal disk, the transverse veins of the tegmina and a broad stripe including the ulnar vein but evenly continued an even distance from the median vein to the tegminal apex. Interval between ulnar stripe and median vein of tegmen greenish, the surfaces adjacent to the transverse veins showing a faint greenish tinge. Antennae of general coloration with very widely separated, rather broad annuli, which in proximal half are whitish and in distal half very dark brown. Length of body 26, length of pronotum 5.9, cephalic width of pronotal disk 3.8, caudal width of pronot'al disk 5.2, depth of pronotal lateral lobe 5, width of pronotal lateral lobe 4.7, length of tegmen 32.8, greatest width of tegmen 19, length of cephalic femur 7.2, length of caudal femur 20.8, length of ovipositor 18, greatest (meso-distal) width of ovipositor 3.8 mm. The type of this extraordinary and leaf-like katydid is unique. Sympaestria lampra new species. Plate XIV, figures 5 and 6. This handsome species appears to resemble closely Haan's nitidifolia32 in general appearance and tegminal venation, differing in having the auditory foramina of the cephalic femora conchate internally, apert externally.32 Karny has recently shown that Dohrn was in error in supposing nitidifolia assignable to Sympaestria and in considering the Brazilian Slibara cornea Brunner a synonym of that species. The differences between those species are there dis- cussed, the decision being that nitidifolia is a species ? Stibara or a memnber of a genuis more nearly related to that entity than to any known Asiatic genus (Zool. Mededeel. Rijks Mus. Nat. Hist. Leiden, V, p. 200, (1920).). </text>

          <text>162 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Vol. LXXIVIn the three specimens before us, the proximal fork of the first branch of the median vein runs to the sutural margin; in the single male, however, the sinistral tegmen has this branch running di- reetly into the ulnar vein, as deseribed for the genotype, Sympaestria acute-lobata Brunner. Unusual individual variation is shown by this same fork being before the middle of the branch in the male, beyond the middle of the branch in the Sandakan female and de- cidedly beyond the middle of the branch in the Labuan female. In the tegmina the ulnar vein to near its apex, the median, its first branch and forks of the same to near their apices and the dis- coidal veins are very heavily defined in the discoidal and scapular fields, other venation being scarcely noticeable to the naked eye. TYPE: Q; Labuan, British North Borneo. [Hebard Collection, Type no. 858.] Size large, form robust but graceful. Vertex rounding strongly ventrad, its surface flattened so that in dorsal aspect it appears truncate, as wide as first antennal joint, showing mesad a short but rather heavy medio-longitudinal sulcus. Pronotum with disk feebly convex, broadening evenly caudad to the nearly semicircular caudal margin, sharply defined from the vertical lateral lobes by well rounded lateral angulation; lateral lobes decidedly deeper than long, cephalic margin straight, broadly rounding into the briefly straight ventral margin, which rounds even more broadly into the weakly convex caudal margin, humeral sinus decided. Tegmina and wings fully developed, the former stiff, shell-like, glossy, ap- pearing smooth to the naked eye, but under the lens seen to be thie,kly and very finely impressed between the myriad of very minute veinlets; veins as described above; tegmina broadest meso- pro-imad, the sutural margin showing there a broadly convex angulation, margins convergent distad to the rather strongly rounded apex. Ovipositor broad, curved upward, apex rounded, dorsal and ventral margins armed distad with regular, small, rounded serrulations. Subgenital plate small, convex, longer than wide, triangularly acute-angulate produced with apex blunted. Cephalic coxae unarmed. Genicular lobes of cephalic and median femora rounded, of caudal femora bispinose. Ventral margins of cephalic and median femora unarmed, of caudal femora with 2 to 5 internal and 3 to 6 external, minute, almost mieroscopic spines. Cephalic tibiae rounded and with a single, minute disto-internal spine dorsad; internal auditory foramen conchate (or better termed moderately swollen, rimate), external auditory foramen apert.

Ultimate tergite produced, truncate distad, lateral portions convex, mesad showing an angulate concavity which is narrowest distad. Supra-anal plate beneath, shield- shaped. Cerci slender, simple, cylindrical, tapering and weakly curved inward to the apex, which is armed with a very minute tooth. Subgenital plate moderately produced, tri-carinate, with lateral carinae rounded; distad bluntly V-emarginate, the lateral portions truncate and surmounted by small, simple styles, slightly longer than the depth of the emargination and three times as long as wide. General coloration rich oil green. Lateral margins of pronotum and stridulating field of tegmen yellowish, beyond the sutural margin of the tegmina is blackish or has the minute intervals between the veinlets blackish, this continued to the apex. Proxi- mad on the tegmina, particularly in the marginal field, moderately large suffused flecks of darker green or purple drab are indicated. Caudal margin of pronotum immaculate in male, faintly margined with black in Labuan female, narrowly but distinctly margined with black in Sandakan female.

This insect is clearly a higher development from a type similar to that of Sympaestria. Brunner separated these species very widely, due to the presence in Dysmorpha of apert auditory fora- mina on both faces of the cephalic tibiae. Though representing a Group, the Dysmorphae, we place it immediately after the genus Sympaestria. The female before us is found to resemble the type closely. The ovipositor is broad, upcurved, with apex rounded, suggesting the type developed in Eulophophyllum. The richness and beauty of the coloration in this insect is very striking. The tegmina - are shell-like, glossy, with stridulating field blackish brown, except for a few small areas of javel green.33 A Sumatran male of this species has subsequently been fully described by Griffini (Wiener Ent. Zeit., XXVIII, p. 105, (1909).) </text>

PLATYCAEDICIA new genus This genus is erected to include species which have a very dif- ferent general facies from the genotype of Caedicia, showing to it much the same general contrast which, in the New World. is found between the genera Amblycorypha and Phaneroptera (Scudderia of recent authors). A general revision of the species of Caedicia is evidently greatly needed, the species now ineluded probably representing several distinct genera. To Platycaedicia belong major (Brunner), obiensis here described and very possibly hospes (Brunner). The latter species was described from Amboina and referred to by Brunner as an Asiatic species. This is incorrect, Amboina being far east of Wallace's line and its fauna distinctively Melanesian. </text>

Plate XIV. figures 13 and 14. This inseet is closely related to P. major (Brunner), differing in the decidedly smaller size, narrower tegmina, less numerous spines of the dorso-external margin of the cephalic tibia and more numerous spines of the ventro-external margin of the caudal femora. To P. hospes (Brunner) it would appear to be nearest in the majority of features, but the slightly sulcate dorsal surface of the cephalic tibiae and tria gular mesosternal and metasternal lobes in that insect may indicate that these species are actually generically distinet. TYPE: Q; Obi Island, Moluccas. [Hebard Collection, Type no. 790.] Vertex narrow, narrowing and evenly and strongly declivent, longitudinally suleate but with the sharply rounded apex entire.

This species, from Brunner's very inadequate description, appears to be closely related to that authors D. flexuoso-cercata, described from New Guinea. In the present insect the pronotal disk is not concave, while the tegmina are irregularly marked with large blotches of darker brown instead of being very weakly orna- mented with oblique darker markings. The heavier structure and pronotum which expands much more strongly caudad and has the ventral margins of the lateral lobes nearly straight and oblique in the Australian genotype, D. latifolia Brunner, may indicate that these species should be separated generically. The Melanesian species agree instead with Bolivar's genus Diastellida, but differ strikingly from that genus in the very conspicuous widening distad of the tegmina. TYPE: 9; Fakfak, Dutch New Guinea.

Kirby has already synonymized brevis and St?l's subnotata from the Philippines. Burmeister's gracilis is not preoccupied by gracilis of Germar, 1817, as supposed by Karny,37 Germar having deseribed a Locusta gracilis. MECOPODINAE After careful consideration of the literature and comparison of the species before us, we believe it best to follow Bolivar's arrange- ment of the sections and genera of this subfamily.38 The remark- able development of the pronotum in the Section Phyllophori does not, in our opinion, warrant its recognition as a distinet subfamily.39 The Sections Phrictae and Segestini40 are, indeed, both more widely divergent from the Section Mecopodi. Section PHRICTAE CHLORACANTHA new genus This genus is based on a single remarkable species here deseribed, differing in a number of important features from the other genera of Section Phrietae. In fact the wholly unarmed femora and caudal tibiae, which are armed distad with a single small pair of ventral spurs, may oblige placement of this inseet in a section of its own. The single species known is of very small size for the Subfamily. GENOTYPE.-Chloracantha lampra new species. Antennal serobes very large, their margins moderately produced latero-ventrad and produced, attingent and rounding dorso-mesad; thus with nariowly triangular, suleate vertex fitting tightly between them dorsad and the very narrowly triangular facial fastigium similarly fitting tightly between them on the cephalic face. Eyes globose and very prominent. Antennae very long, with proximal joints smooth. Frons- reelinate, smooth, slightly higher than wide. Pronotum with disk flat, the two transverse sulei straight and deep, with a weakly indicated medio-longitudinal suleus; cepbalie and caudal margins of disk both very feebly convex and nodulose, lateral margins straight, nearly parallel, armed with large, rounded spinies. Lateral lobes of pronotum vertical, decidedly longer than37 Zool. Mededeel, Rijks MIus. Nat. Hist. Leiden (1920); and Philippine Jour. Sci., XVIII, p. 616, (1921). 38 Ann. Mus. Nat.

Plate XIV, figures 15 and 16; plate XV, figure 2. This species is widely distinguished from those of the genera, nearest to which it is placed, by its small size and great differences in the pronotal, tegminal and limb development. The heavily spined lateral margins of the pronotum and green coloration, with beautifully but delicately marked tegmina, give this little insect a very distinctive appearance. TYPE: c; Townsville, Queensland, Australia. [Hebard Col- lection, Type no. 807.] In addition to the characters given in the generic description, the following are noted. Size small, form moderately slender. Maxillary palpi moderately elongate, fourth joint slightly shorter than third, third three-quarters as long as the fifth, the latter ex- panding distad at the obliquely truncate apex. Lateral margins of pronotal disk with large, rather slender, blunt spines, directed laterad and weakly dorsad, two on the prozona, two on the meso- zona and three on the metazona on each side, the first and last much smaller than the others; lateral lobes with ventral margin nearly straight and weakly oblique, this margin and the rounded ventral angles supplied with irregular tubereles, three such tubereles being also present on the face of the lateral lobe. Tegminal vena- tion forming a large and rather irregular series of angular areas; apex of tegmen at costal margin, broadly rounded. Supra-anal plate produced in a hooded lobe, with sides curling inward so that only a narrow vertical slit is seen meso-caudad and completely concealing the cerci. Subgenital plate small, narrowing to the narrowly V-emarginate apex. Cephalic tibiae narrow very gradu- ally beyond the auditory foramina. General coloration light elm green. Eyes warm sepia.

This insect is nearest M. salomonis Kirby, apparently differing in the dark occiput, pale proximal portions of the antennae, dark caudal margin of the pronotal disk, narrower tegmina and shorter limbs. In general appearance and the majority of generic and higher characters it is seen to agree closely with the species before us, here recorded as Paradiaphlebus notatus Brunner. In such features it differs primarily in having the cephalic femora with auditory fora- mina flattened conchate and in the vertex, which tapers to a minute rounded point with sides swollen, then falling away and sharply concave declivent to another similar projection, immediately above its intersection with the facial fastigium. The present group, ineluding these genera and Diaphlebus, requires careful revision and until this is done the proper number of valid genera contained can not be determined.

These differences may be due to inaccuracies in drawing, as Kirby has already assigned the species to the genus Paradiaphlebus,43 a genus ereeted by Bolivar44 to inelude those species previously assigned to Diaph- lebus, in which the auditory foramina are apert. In the present specimen the general coloration is light green, the pronotal dorsum, apices of the femora and distal half of the ovi- positor suffused with brown. The tegmina have the veinlets of the stridulating field heavy and buffy, beyond along the costal margin more delicate, but of the same color. The intervals between these veinlets are brown toward the anal vein, but blackish toward the sutural margin to the apices of the tegmina, this invading the veins at the apex of the stridulating field and there forming a large, longitudinal blackish suffusion. The ovipositor is nearly straight, eurving very weakly dorsad. The subgenital plate is scoop-shaped, with lateral margins concave-convergent to apex, which is shallowly concave-emarginate, with a very small rounded projection at each side. The cephalic tibiae have the auditory foramina apert, but, with ventral margin distinetly lamellate, particularly proximad. The ventral femoral margins are armed with the following spines. Cephalie internal 5 and 5, cephalic external 0, median internal 0, median external 6 and 6, caudal internal 7 and 7, caudal external 12 and 12.

In the present material the spines of the caudal femora are blackish brown, tinged at their bases with the same color, while the dorso-internal margins of the median tibiae are armed with from two to four spines, sometimes in the same specimen. The ovipositor is straight, not weakly curved, but this again does not appear to constitute a safe specific character in the genus. We recognize punctipes as valid due to the female subgenital plate, described as " triangularis, elongata, acuminata, apice incisa, lobis angustis acuminatis." In the females here recorded this plate is short, the lateral margins strongly convergent and rounding into the apex, which is weakly rotundato-trigonal emar- ginate, in this respect agreeing more closely with S. unicolor Redtenbacher, from Pelew Island. The heavy blackish brown suffusion on the dorsal half of the internal face of the caudal femora proximad is a striking feature in the material at hand.

That species is particularly distinguished by the more evidently rugulose pronotum with shallower lateral lobes, tegmina which are slightly broader distad and there run to a point at the sutural margin, heavier and fewer dark spots on the tegmina, dark internal suffusion of the caudal femora and presence of a small spine disto-dorsad on the external surface of the cephalic tibiae. These differences would appear to make confusion impossible, but, were the specimens not carefully examined; their general resemblance is so decided that one might easily fail to recognize the presence of two species.

EIMECOPODA new genus The present genus is erected to include certain of the species pre- viously placed in Mecopoda Serville. GENOTYPE.-Eumecopoda cyrtoscelis (Karsch). This genus differs from Mecopoda, as here restricted, in the fol- lowing features. Head with apex of vertex transversely and bluntly carinate. Pronotum with disk flattened, subeoncave, lateral margins carinate, overhanging, the incisions formed by the trans- verse sulci sharply angulate emarginate, caudal margin with a minute dorsal tubercle mesad, which is often subobsolete. Tegmina with sutural margin, from meso-distal point of greatest width, broadly convex, then broadly concave to the acute apex, so that the tips- of the tegmiina are somewhat falcate. Cephalic tibiae with auditory foramina conchate to subconchatie, in the latter condition partly apert but with ventral margin produced and cov- ering a portion of the membrane. Caudal femora dorsad and laterad bluntly and longitudinally carinate, there supplied dorsad with blunt tubercles to relatively heavy, blunt tuberculations. To this genus belong the following species. At the present time insufficient material is available to determine whether all of these are valid. </text>

Euzecopoda reducta new species. Plate XVI, figure 6. This insect is apparently nearest E. walkeri (Kirby), the only previously known Malayan member of the present genus. From the unsatisfactory description of the unique female type of that insect, the single male before us is separated by the immaculate vertex and unarmed ventral femoral margins. Adequate diagnosis of walkeri will probably reveal other distinctive features. Compared with the other species of Eumecopoda, the present insect differs greatly in the very much shorter limbs and organs of flight, the unarmed ventral femoral margins and caudal femora which are as strongly carinate as in E. cyrtoscelis (Karsch), but bear fewer and smaller tuberculations. From the males before us, further difference is shown by the strong medio-dorsal projections of the abdominal tergites and the much shorter cerci and subgenital plate, the latter bearing at its apices minute but distinct styles.47 In general form the present insect shows dloser resemblance to species of the genus Characta, from which genus it may be instantly separated by the broad, transversely carinate and undivided vertex. TYPE: e; Butuan, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 853.] Size comparatively small, form very short for the genus. Vertex truncate distad, nearly transverse, bluntly but decidedly trans- versely carinate, due to a weak concavity of the dorsal surface toward this carina, which itself, unliked in the other species, pro- jects slightly beyond the plane of the face. Face and genae mod- erately, occiput and pronotum very thickly impresso-punctulate. Pronotum shorter than in other species, with incisions of the strongly carinate lateral margins, at transverse sulci, much smaller'7 Smaller but otherwise as in Mecopoda elongata (Linnaeus). </text>

It differs from the unsatisfactory deseription of that inseet in having the dorsal surface of the enlarged proximal portion of the caudal femora rugose, coarsely and roundly subdenticulate along the dorsal carina, in the proportionately broader tegmina and apparently average larger size. The following deseription of this little known species is sub- mitted for the convenience of future workers. Female. Size large. Vertex truncate distad, subeonvex, trans- versely bluntly but decidedly carinate; distinctly wider at sulcus formed with frontal fastigium than in E. cyrtoscelis (Karsch). Pronotum with a medio-longitudinal line, which becomes sub- carinate in metazonal portion, terminating at caudal margin in a small rounded tuberele, which scarcely projeets caudad of that margin. Lateral lobes of pronotum slightly higher than wide, perpendicular, ventro-cephalic angles produced in a minute roundly acute-angulate projection; ventral margin sinuous, with a produced tuberele projecting from a prothoracic pleurite slightly caudad of the ventro-cephalic angle; ventro-caudal angle broadly rounded and weakly produced. Tegmina broad, expanding to meso-distal point, where they are distinetly wider than in cyrtoscelis; distinctly faleate distad. Ovipositor elongate, curved weakly upward. Sub- genital plate convex, with distal margin rather broadly bilobate. Cephalic and median femora rugulose, weakly carinate dorsad in distal portions. Caudal femora heavy proximad, specialized as deseribed above. Ventral femoral margins armed (in the series) as follows.

Cerci elongate, moderately stout but tapering strongly and durving inward to apex, which is more strongly curved inward and terminates in a minute tooth. Subgenital plate elongate produced, deeply V-emarginate distad, the lateral portions weakly divergent, tapering to their acute apices, with- out styles, but each, unlike cyrtoscelis, armed with a minute sub- apical tooth on the internal margin. </text>

Mottled, with paler yentral portions of caudal tibiae heavily banded with suffusions of dark brown at the spines. Antennae dark, with five to seven widely spaced, striking annuli of buffy. Tegmina mottled in large, solid areas, irregular in outline, with different shades of brown and showing often a number of desiccated-appearing patches, some of these occasionally shining blackish brown, the maj ority buffy brown. Caudal femoral spines dark only at tips. As is usual in this type of coloration, the occiput, disk of pronotum and anal field of the tegmina are often of a distinctly paler shade than the adjacent portions. The coloration in such irregularly mottled katydids, which clearly resemble dead and dried foliage, is so subject to individual variation that it can not be more definitely described for the species.

The enormous stridulating field of the male is 26.4 milli- meters in length, 18.3 in width, the stridulating vein 14.7 milli- meters long. The large, transparent, rounded speculum of the dextral tegmen, bounded by a very high and heavily chitinous wall caudad, probably aids greatly in producing what should be one of the very loudest of insect stridulations. The extreme basal slenderness of the caudal femora (these limbs are present only in the male before us), armed with rather decided spines ventrad, is a striking feature. Greatest width proximad 3.9, median width 3, distal width 3.7 millimeters. The greater distal width is caused by a pronounced medio-longitudinal, dorsal carina being there developed.

The female before us appears to represent the same species as the male, the differences shown being attributable to sexual di- versity. This can, however, not be proven conclusively without comparison of additional material, though van Vollenhoven was satisfied as to the specific agreement of Bornean and Javanese ma- terial.

PSEUDOPHYLLINAE Ini the literature on this subfamily several unusual difficulties are encountered whieh we think should be pointed out, to aid the student in avoiding further confusion. Brunner's key, in his Monograph, is particularly unsatisfaetory in one portion. Sections 4 and 4' under seetion 3' are exceedingly misleading and speeies running to this point should always be tried for both. The attem )t by Saussure and Pietet, in their "Ieonographie des Sauterelles Vertes," to use data written them by Redtenbacher, has caused a most unfortunate confusion of generie names. That study was published in 1892 and Brunner, publishing the "Mono- graphie der Pseudophylliden" in 1895, most unfortunately did not follow the generie assignments there made. Added to this are the older genera deseribed by Walker and ignored by sub- sequent authors, which Kirby at last placed in his "Synonymie Catalogue of Orthoptera," Vol. III, in 1906. Thus we find Microprion P. and S. a synonym of Phyllomimus St?l, but Microprion Brunner a distinet genus, renamed Micropion by Kirby. Oxyscelus Brunner a synonym of Tympanoptera P. and S., but Tympanoptera Brunner a synonym of Aprion Serville, and Aprion P. and S. a synonym of Morsimus St?l. We, however, </text>

This insect closely resembles the figure of Rhomboptera honor- abilis (Brunner)50 except that the transverse veins of the discoidal field alternate at the ulnar and branch of the median veins, being neither contiguous (percurrent) or subcontiguous. It appears very possible that this charaeter is of no generic value. Should this prove to be the case, Rhomboptera would fall as a synonym of Pseudophyllus. The present insect is further separable from R. honorabilis by its decidedly larger size, longer limbs and much longer ovipositor. The median tibiae are armed with very small spines; the figure of honorabilis shows much heavier spines on these members.

Such a spot is individually absent or present, but variable in size, in the series of P. detersus (Walker) before us. It is evident that this feature is of no specific diagnostic value in these species. The ovipositor is here figured, as it is very different from that of detersus.

          <text>1922] NATURAL SCIENCES OF PHILADELPHIA 197To the previously established synonymy for the present species, (sinensis Walker, granulosus St?l and truncatifolia Pictet and Saussure), we add the above. It appears that the common Philippine insect before us is the species recognized as detersus by Kirby, after examination of the type. The greatest confusion has apparently been caused by Brunner who, failing to recognize the variability of the species, considered the two Philippine species deseribed by St?l to be valid and described two more. The species is exceedingly plastic, as the series of sixteen specimens, now before us, amply demonstrates. Baguio, Benguet, Luzon, Philippine Islands, (from C. F. Baker), 1 9. Polillo Island, Luzon, Philippine Islands, (E. H. Taylor), 2 9. Los Bafnos, Laguna, Luzon, Philippine Islands, (from C. F. Baker),1 d,3 9. Mount Makiling, Luzon, Philippine Islands, (from C. F.

Baker), 1 9. Davao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands, (from C. F. Baker), 2 9. Singapore, British Straits Settlements, (from C. F. Baker), 1 e. The present insect is subject to very great individual size vari- ation, irrespective of geographic distribution. St?l gave 39 to 58 mm. for length including tegmina, for this dimension the present series shows the following extremes; e 34.5 to 42.5, 9 40 to 68 mm. The tegminal venation is irregular and the branching of the veinlets of the scapular field (used as a specific character by Brunner) particularly so. Though usually with a black spot meso-proximad between the median and ulnar veins of the tegmina, individuals without this spot occur, others showing it reduced to different degrees. In the smallest and one of the largest females at hand, the caudal femora distad and caudal tibiae are purplish pink. A rather similar individual color variation apparently constituted one of the reasons for Brunner's describing rufatus. The measurements (in millimeters) of selected specimens from the series before us are as follows: </text>

This species differs widely from P. detersus (Walker).58 rThe tegminal markings are distinetive, though very faint. In the present species the wings fail to reach the extremities of the tegmina by a very brief distance, but show, nevertheless, decided atrophy, quite unfitting them for even usefulness as parachutes. The present specimen is much smaller than the female described by Brunner as pallidus. The species, like detersus, is probably subject to decided size variation.

Phyllomimus tonkinae new species. Plate XVII, figure 4. This insect appears nearest P. inquinatus Brunner, deseribed from a unique female, from Penang, British Straits Settlements. The present male differs from the description and a male of that species before us, in being dark green in coloration, the tegmina with nearly colorless areas between the veins distad, with minute callosities mesad in all the larger areolae, which are whitish, except those between the ulnar and median vein which are dark. It is a much heavier and decidedly less delicate insect, the male body bulk being much greater and the organs of flight less developed, the tegmina narrowing more decidedly distad to the much narrower57 The body is shrivelled in this specimen. 88 The above synonymy has recently been indicated by Karny (Zool.

The very small size of the stridulating field and its strong and suddenly convex projection at the apex of the stridulating veins and the greatly reduced wings are other important features for separating the males of these species. TYPE: &amp;; Than- Moi, Tonkin. June and July. (From H. Fruh- storfer.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 814.] Size small, form robust for the genus. Pronotal surface rather thickly supplied with minute, low tubereles, the largest on the cephalic margin; ventral margin of lateral lobes weakly convex, showing a weak angulation. Tegmina broad, greatest width of scapular field nearly equal to greatest width of discoidal field; stridulating field very small, suddenly and roundly produced at apex of stridulating vein; costal margin broadly convex, sutural margin faintly convex, apex rounded and situated at the sutural margin. Wings greatly reduced, about two-thirds as long as teg- mina, spatulate in contour, all but the anterior portion of the radiate field having disappeared. Supra-anal plate as long as broad, with free margin convex. Cerci moderately elongate, curving gradually inward and tapering to the minutely toothed apex. A large plate lies between these, bearing a minute tooth, directed dorsad and curved mesad, meso-proximad on each side. Subgenital plate of the usual Pseudophyllid type, rather short, with styles rather broadly spatulate. Ventral surfaces of femora moderately hairy, spines of cephalic and median femora mere tubereles, of ventro-external margins of caudal femora very small, in number as follows. Cephalic internal 3, cephalic external 0 (but rugulose), median internal 0, median external 3 and 6, caudal internal 0 and 4, caudal external 10 and 11. Ventro-external margins of median and caudal femora lamellate. Cephalic margin of metazona raised, roughened mesad, weakly tuberculate laterad. General coloration forest green. Tubereles on cephalic margin of pronotum whitish green. Distal margins of abdominal tergites and dorsal margin of caudal femora purplish. Tegmina marked as described above, their ventral surfaces weakly washed with purplish in the more transparent areas, immediate costal margin whitish proximad.

          <text>200 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Vol. LXXIVThe previously unknown male of this species in general appear- ance resembles much more closely males of Timanthes than those of the other heavier and much less delicate species of Phyllomimus. We note the following characters of interest for this sex. Tegmina ample, costal margin verv weakly convex and sutural margin almost straight from the broadly convex margin of the anal field to the distal extremity, where these margins curve into the very broad, transverse and scarcely convex distal margin. Wings extending caudad as far as tegmina. General coloration pale green, immaculate except for a few very small brown flecks, each mesad in the larger tegminal areo- lae. Dorsal margins of fermora lamellate and very mieroscopically serrulate. Ventral femoral margins armed with spines, which are very minute on the cephalic femora and almost as small on the median femora, as follows. Cephalic internal 2 and 3, cephalic ex- ternal 0, median internal 6 and 6, median external 8 and 9, caudal internal 12 and 15, caudal external 13 and 18 (of which about 10 to 12 are distinct). Phyllozelus abbottiss new species. Though in many respeets resembling Phyllomimus closely, the species of this genus may be quickly separated by the bispinose prosternum, acute tegmina, with branch of median vein sharply bent and thence parallel to the straight ulnar and median veins, limbs with genicular lobes bluntly triangular, caudal femora with ventro-external margin not lamellate but well spined and other less striking features. The present insect apparently differs from the previously known species in having the dorsal margin of the caudal femora only minutely tuberculate. From P. siccus (Walker) it differs further in the ventral margins of the pronotal lateral lobes, which show a weak, rounded obtuse angulation, while the caudal tibiae have the dorso-internal margin minutely serrulate. Walker's descriptions of signatus and brevi- usculus are too vague for any definite comparison, though they appear to be based on forms agreeing much more closely with siccus. From P. genicularis Saussure and Pictet, it differs further in the decidedly smaller size, immaculate anal field of the tegmina, pro- portionately narrower tegmina, ovipositor which is shorter than the caudal femur, in the unarmed ventro-caudal margins of the cephalic femora and in the spines of the ventro-external margins of the caudal femora, which increase evenly in size distad.59 Named in honor of our friend, Dr. William L. Abbott, who for years galhered nvaluable collections in the Malayan region. </text>

National Museum.] Size small for the genus, form robust. Vertex horizontal, sharply acute, projecting very slightly beyond the antennal scrobes and moderately sulcate throughout. Pronotum densely beaded, with ventral margins of lateral lobes very weakly rounded obtuse- angulate (as figured for genicularis by Saussure and Pictet). Tegmina fully developed, with convexity of costal margin stronger than that of sutural margin, so that the very sharply rounded, acute apex is at the latter. Wings extending as far caudad as the tegmina, but apparently narrow. Supra-anal plate triangular, slightly longer than wide, with lateral margins weakly convex and apex sharply rounded; surface convex and sub-tectate. Ovi- positor shorter than caudal femur, dorsal margin almost straight, feebly sinuous, serrulate in meso-distal portion; ventral margin straight proximad, curving meso-distad to the acute apex and sub- serrulate distad; lateral surface with (four and five) oblique, sharp, delicate distal ridges on dorsal valves and a blunt node below these on ventral valves. Limbs moderately pilose. Dorsal femoral margins lamellate and very minutely tuberculate, this very weak for median femora. Ventral femoral margins armed as follows. Cephalic internal 6 and 7, cephalic external 0, median internal 6 and 6, median external 3 and 4, caudal internal 9 and 9, caudal external 12 and 16. Dorso-internal margin of caudal tibiae weakly lamellate and minutely serrulate. General coloration buckthorn brown tinged with tawny and quite uniform. Ovipositor deepening to tawny distad and still darker at apex.

The type is unique. Gonyatopus gemmiculus new species. Plate XVII, figures 5, 6 and 7. This delicate and beautiful little inseet does not have the external genicular lobes of the cephalic femora compressed and horizontally produced, but in all other respeets agrees so closely with the de- scription of Gonyatopus that we do not feel justified in erecting a new genus to inelude it. The mesosternum in this species, however, does not have the margins simple, as might be inferred from Brunner's generic de- scription, while the form and coloration of the cephalic coxal spine is a most remarkable feature in gemmiculus, not mentioned elsewhere for other of the species. The species is apparently nearest the Philippine G. integer </text>

Closely related to the Formosan T. unicolor62 Matsumura and Shiraki,63 the present females may be distinguished by their slightly smaller size, much smaller pronotum, longer tegmina, shorter ovipositor and the lamellate and much more abundantly spinose ventro-external margins of the median and caudal femora. This genus is clearly very near Tympanoptera, differing in the subobsolete medio-longitudinal sulcation of the pronotum, narrower ovipositor which is evenly though weakly curved upward, shorter tegmina with veins not minutely tuberculate proximad, median vein forking slightly beyond end of proximal fourth, greater distal divergence of discoidal and median veins and sinuous ulnar and branch of the median vein. TYPE: 9 ; Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 818.] Size small, form moderately slender, structure delicate. Vertex acute, projecting very slightly beyond antennal serobes, dorsal surface concave to near apex. Pronotum weakly tuberculate with a weak medio-longitudinal line defined by lateral carinulae, which are mainly indicated by tubercles, with two transverse sulci which are not interrupted mesad; caudal margin of disk convex, humeral sinus obtuse-angulate but distinct, other margins weakly tuberculate; lateral lobes higher than wide, ventro-cephalic angle rounded rectangulate, ventral margin very weakly convex, ventro- caudal angle sharply rectangulate. Tegmina and wings fully developed and capable of sustained flight. Tegmina with costal margin broadly convex, sutural margin almost straight to the rather sharply rounded apex at its distal extremity; veins of dis- coidal field parallel in greater part, though the ulnar and branch of the median vein are sinuous, median vein branching slightly before end of proximal fourth and diverging from discoidal vein in distal third; majority of cross-veinlets of discoidal field transverse and straight, those of scapular field irregularly branching and moderately oblique. Supra-anal plate linguliform, medio-longi- tudinally carinate. Ovipositor not heavy for group, curving62 Karny has recorded a male from Los Banios, Luzon, Philippine Islands, as unicolor, having compared it with Formosan males of that species. That in- dividual almost certainly represents the present insect and it is probable that the differences in limb structure were not noted (Philippine Jour. Sci., XVIII, p. 610, (1921).) 63 The figure originally given of unicolor does not show the acute-angulate branching of the median vemn, nor the gradual distal divergence of the discoidal and median veins of the tegmina, found in the material here treated. This is probably attributable to faulty drawing. </text>

Supra-anal plate apparently slightly longer than wide (partially pulled inward in this specimen), triangular, with lateral margins convex and medio-longitudinally carinate. Ovipositor moderately heavy; dorsal margin nearly straight, weakly convex proximad, thence weakly concave and very finely serrulate; ventral margin broadly convex meso-distad to the acute apex, with distal margin very finely serrulate; dorsal valves disto-laterad with five weakly oblique, sharp but delicate, transverse ridges. Sub- genital plate very small, delicate, truncate trigonal. Ventro- external margins of median and caudal femora weakly lamellate.

Head with occiput laterad washed with olive buff. Antennae cream col?r with a faint greenish tinge. Pronotum ochraceous-buff dorsad, shading to olive buff"' See plate XVII, figures 9, 10 and 11. This remarkable type of femoral spination is developed in the species of this and a number of other Pseudophyllid genera, which follow in linear arrangement. 65 The number of such spines is evidently so variable that probably little of specific diagnostic value will be found. The actual number of femoral spines is probably very rarely constant in any species of the Tettigoniidae, though the average for a species, when sufficient material is available to determine it, will probably often be found to differ from that for related species. It is for this reason that we have given the exaet spine count, in the present paper, for the new species described; as an aid in beginning to find the averages for these species, but certainly not to distinguish them from their allies on the basis of the exact number of spines present. </text>

This species, compared with the brief original deseription of the Bornean C. rubromarginata (Haan) is seen to be very closely related, differing only in the small but very distinetive tegminal markings. TYPE: c; Singapore, British Straits Settlements. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 817.] In addition to the features given in the generic deseription, we note the following: Size small, form rather slender, structure very delicate. Vertex acute, feebly concave mesad, extending slightly beyond margins of antennal scrobes and there slightly reflexed to the sharply rounded apex. iPronotum with two medio-longitudinal rows of slender but prominent tubercles, separated by a short interval; margins tuberculate, the surface elsewhere very faintly subtuber- culate; three transverse sulec present, of which the median alone is deep and alone cuts the median line of the pronotum, this occurring mesad. Tegmina and wings fully developed and capable of sus- tained flight. Tegmina very broad, anal field small, its free margin concave before and convex at the stridulating vein; thence the sutural margin is straight, distad curving to the rather broadly rounded apex, the costal margin convex, decidedly so proximad; anal field beyond stridulating area thickly filled with minute, irregular veinlets; median vein branching mesad, connecting veins of discoidal field in most cases perfeetly transverse; transverse veins of scapular field not numerous, weakly oblique, the more proximal forking irregularly. Supra-anal plate nearly twice as long as wide, lateral margins weakly convergent, rounding distad into the truncate apex. Cerci simple, cylindrical, moderately elongate, tapering weakly to the rounded apex, which is armed with a minute tooth directed inward. Subgenital plate narrowed suddenly mesad, the distal half very slender, expanding very slightly distad and bearing very delicate, paddle-shaped styles. Ventral femoral margins armed with minute compound spines, except externally on the caudal femora, where the more distal spines, though small, are considerably larger.

[9n, nknown locality.] Toungoo, Burma, (A. V. B. Crumb), 1 e, 1 9, [A. N. S. P.]. The species of this genus apparently all show decided individual variation, the projections of the pronotum, tegmina and limbs being irregular and the irregular, mottled markings, resembling bark, also differing in shade and distribution in each individual. The present specimens differ from the individual, here recorded as S. marmorata St?l, only in having the elevation of the pronotal disk very slight in its caudal portion and the meso-distal convexity of the dorsal surface of the cephalic tibiae much weaker. Additional material may prove synonymy, but we believe that Brunner did not possess sufficient material to justify his action of placing this name under S. rugosa (Linnaeus). Comparison of the present specimens with material of that species before us, from India and Ceylon, shows marked differentiation in the strongly swollen basal portion of the occiput, much more decided tegminal shoulders at the base of the ulnar vein (resembling those developed in some Phasmids), deeper general coloration and specialized cephalic tibiae.

The pale face, truncate tegmina and black spines of the cephalic femora distinguish this insect. In the present specimen the head and thorax ventrad, limbs and even the first antennal joints are thickly supplied with long silky hairs, which are strikingly evident. The general coloration is grayish brown, the tegmina irregularly mottled with pale greenish and rusty brown. The costal margin of the sinistral tegmen has three, that of the dextral tegmen six, moderately large, rounded triangular projections. The previously unknown male has the supra-anal plate small, produced and shield-shaped. The cercus is nearly semicircular, with apex minutely toothed.

The pronotum, with disk flattened, in shape somewhat suggests the Listroscelid genus Hexacentrus; its lateral lobes much deeper but otherwise agreeing with those of Oxylakis. The teg- mina widen gradually distad, as in the Listroscelid genus Para- hexacentrus and are strikingly truncate, though not to as great a degree as in Eppia. The armament of the limbs in some respects resembles that of Oxylakis truincatipennis Bolivar.69 The armament of the mesosternum and met-asternum is nearest that of Oxystethus. The ovipositor shows a striking, development, not known to us in any other genus of the Tettigoniidae. In spite of all these differences, the present species runs to68 In allusion to the very superficial resemblance, which the truncate tegmlina give individuals of this genus, to the tropical American Eppwa truncatipennis St?l. 69 A species which we believe should be removed from that genus. </text>

Ovipositor elongate and slender, unarmed, of the usual Copiphorine type developed in this genus, widening slightly beyond its base, then narrowing as weakly to the moderately acute apex, so that it is widest mesad. Subgenital plate distorted, apparently decidedly produced and strongly concave at apex, fitting tightly about the ventral portion of the ovipositor base. Femoral genicular lobes developed as follows; cephalic internal and median internal strongly acute-angulate produced, cephalic ex- ternal rounded, median external bluntly triangular, caudal internal and external heavily unispinose. Cephalic and median femora thickened, the ventral femoral margins armed with large spines, between which are minute spines, as follows. Cephalic internal 3 and 3 large, 8 and 9 small; cephalic external 0 large, 2 and 2 small; median internal 0, median external 4 and 4 large, 9 and 9 small; caudal internal 0; caudal external 5 large, 7 small. General coloration clay color; face evenly suffused with tawny; dorsal surface of vertex, occiput, pronotum mesad and tegmina proximad, evenly suffused with mars brown. Antennae ochra- ceous-tawny, proximad with intersections of joints slightly darker, mars brown; distad uniform cinnamon-brown. Tegmina clay color with veinlets paler, with very numerous small flecks of blackish chestnut brown which are more numerous in half toward costal margin. Limbs and ovipositor clear ochraceous tawny; the former with femora briefly shining blackish brown distad, this weak on cephalic femora, strong and sharply defined on the others; the tibiae with a similar but very much more limited and inconspicuous marking proximad and distad, the cephalic tibiae suffused with that color very briefly dorsad at end of auditory foraminal area.

Fastigium of vertex produced in a straight, very slenderly conical projection, its narrow apex truncate. Face as in A. major here described. Tegmina much reduced, total length probably near that of pronotum, nar- rowing and rounding into the truncate apices; stridulating field in normal position wholly concealed by pronotum. Ultimate tergite with caudal margin weakly and triangularly bilobate produced caudad. Supra-anal plate vertical and tucked in between cerci, apparently broadly rotundato-trigonal. Cerci very short and heavy, dorsal surface flattened convex, disto-external angle sharply rounded rectangulate, disto-internal angle produced in a stout, decurved tooth. Subgenital plate flattened, lateral portions nar- rowly reflexed, the lateral margins gradually descending to apex, but in ventral aspect the sides appear parallel; distad strongly W-emarginate, the narrow lateral apices thus formed bearing a small socketed style disto-ventrad, above which they are ter- minated in a tooth of equal size, curved dorsad; the median pro- duced portion narrowly triangular and directed dorso-caudad. Femoral genicular lobes as follows; cephalic internal acutely tri- angular-produced, cephalic external and median external rounded, triangularly-produced, median internal unispinose, caudal internal and external bispinose.

The type of this handsome little insect is unique. Anthracites apoensis new species. Plate XVIII, figures 3 and 4. Closely resembling A. zebra, deseribed above, in size and pale coloration, the present species may be readily distinguished by its pale face, more extensively and differently marked pronotum and abdomen, more abbreviated tegmina and by striking male genitalic differences. TYPE: &amp;i; Mount Apo, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. June and July. (E. A. Mearns.) [United States National Museum.] Agrees closely with zebra, except as follows. Fastigium of vertex produced in a straight, very slenderly conical projection, its apex very sharply rounded, almost aciculate. Tegmina greatly re- duced, much shorter than pronotum, with distal margin very broadly convex; stridulating field fully developed, but in normal position wholly concealed by pronotum. Ultimate tergite broadly and weakly concave disto-mesad, the deflexed supra-anal plate oval, with a broad medio-longitudinal suleus. Cerci very heavy and short, broader than long, strongly inflated conical with dorso- internal portion sublamellate and produced distad slightly beyond apex proper, armed with a stout, feebly curved spine, direeted mesad; ventro-internally with a weakly incurved, very slenderly cylindrical process, directed caudad and armed at apex with a small spine, directed mesad and immediately below the dorsal spine; between these the internal surface of the cercus is flattened. Lower podical plates chitinized along dorsal margins, terminating in a flattened, uncinate spine. Subgenital plate flattened, lateral portions narrowly reflexed, then curled outward, so that the lateral margins themselves are seen from below to be weakly convex con- vergent to the briefly produced latero-caudal apices; very broadly and deeply U-emarginate distad, the narrow lateral apices thus formed bearing a small, apical, socketed style, with an internal tooth of equal size, directed meso-dorsad.

The present insect appears to be nearest N. inflata Brunner, described from the Island of Celebes. The female of that insect is unknown, but the ovipositor of the female of the apparently closely related N. nigrifrons Brunner, described from the Island of Lombok, agrees with that of taylori. From inflata this species differs in having the proximal antennal segments pale, merely flecked with dark brown, the pronotal disk having dark lateral bands only, which are interrupted on the prozona and do not invade the lateral lobes and in having the limbs entirely pale, with pale spines. TYPE: 9; Polillo Island, Luzon, Philippine Islands. (E. H. Taylor.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 837.] Average in size and form for the genus. Head and pronotum smooth and shining, showing a few minute subobsolete impressions. Pronotum with sulci strongly defined in dorsal portions of lateral lobes, convex callosity below humeral sinus more prominent and outlined by a more decided suleus than normal in the genus. Teg- mina and wings fully developed, the former widening slightly to the broadly rounded apex. Ovipositor short and broader than is usual in the genus, curved dorsad, broadening gradually to median point, then narrowing gradually to the very acute apex. Subgenital plate subehitinous except at the thickened distal portions, truncate, transverse, leaving the decidedly hairy ventro-proximal portion of the ovipositor exposed. Genicular lobes of femora as follows; cephalic and median internal unispinose, cephalic and median external bluntly triangularly produced, caudal all bispinose. Ventral femoral margins armed as follows. Cephalic internal 6 and 6, cephalic external 7 and 7, median internal 3 and 3, median external 7 and 7, caudal internal 2 (and 8 very small), caudal external 11. General coloration dlay color. Head with two small, weakly suleate, postocular lines of blackish brown. Entire face shining black; median ocellus, clypeus and labrum dlay color. Proximal antennal joint dlay color with a minute suffusion of dark brown, antennae in other portions uniform dlay color. Pronotum with lateral margins of disk defined irregularly in blackish brown, this forming a triangle to the first transverse suleus, interrupted and subobsolete to next suleus, thence broken to principal suleus and heavy from that point to caudal margin of disk. Tegmina trans- parent dlay color, with proximal portion of discoidal field weakly suffused with chestnut brown. Limbs and spines immaculate, dlay color.

Apparently nearest N. taylori here described, the present species is quickly separated by the suffused but much paler face, solidly black irregular bands separating the disk from the lateral lobes of the pronotum, not as decided convex callosity of the lateral lobes below the humeral sinus, delicately though distinetively marked limbs, decidedly more elongate ovipositor which is curved less strongly upward and tapers evenly from the basal portion and dark spines of the ventral femoral margins. Discovery of the male of taylori will probably show marked genitalic differences to further distinguish that sex of these species. TYPE: o; Mount Makiling, Luzon, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 838.] Agrees fully with the deseription of taylori, except in the following features. Size somewhat smaller and caudal margin of the pro- notal disk slightly more convex, as would be expected for the male when compared with the female sex. Convex callosity of lateral lobes of pronotum normal for the genus, not as decided as in taylori. Ultimate tergite truncate distad and hairy; supra-anal plate vertical and largely concealed by the arms of the cerci. Cerci heavy, very short, convex conical, but with minute apex acute, in length slightly exceeding their proximal width; meso-dorsad furnished on the internal surface with a cylindrical arm as long as the cercus, direeted mesad with distal portion bent slightly meso-caudad, tapering to the apex which is armed with a heavy, weakly curved spine; beyond this on the ventro-internal margin of the cercus is another arm, forming with it a V-shaped interval with apex truncate, this more distal arm two-thirds as elongate, straight, similarly cylindrical and tapering to the rounded apex which is armed with a similar spine on its proximal face, this spine forming an obtuse angulation with the shaft of this arm. Subgenital plate feebly tricarinate distad, these carinae low and rounded, the distal margin between the styles angulate-emarginate at slightly less than ninety degrees, the lateral projections thus formed with apices bluntly rounded.

Ovipositor elongate, slender, tapering evenly from beyond base to the acute apex; weakly curved dorsad, this not as decided as in taylori and strongest meso-distad. Subgenital plate of the same type developed in this sex of taylori, the thickened distal portion heavier and more extensive, the transverse distal margin showing a weak trace of bilobation. General coloration of male buckthorn brown tinged with tawny. Occiput, vertex and genae of that color, the occiput with a post- ocular line on each side of dark brown; face heavily suffused, mars brown, with a faint vertical median line of prouts brown; median ocellus buff, clypeus buffy, this deepening on labrum to russet distad, mandibles black. Antennae ochraceous-tawny, with inter- seetions of a few joints darkened.

[ 9; Obi Island, Moluccas.] Karny, in his revision, overlooked Dohrn's Indo-Malayan Cono- cephalid paper of 1905, in which three species of this genus were deseribed, and as a result described the female of the present species as bimaculata, belonging to a series in which "dorso medio pronoti toto nigro differunt."

In general appearance the male resembles that sex of Macroxiphus vaginatus Pictet, but closer examination shows the numerous distinctive features by which these genera are separated, while striking dif- ferences in coloration are then also noted. The remarkable cerci of the male are different from those of any other Tettigoniid known. TYPE: c?; Zamboanga, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.)

Baker), 1 large juv. 9. In spite of the very inadequate original description, we believe the present insect to be correetly located. The only feature in any way disturbing is that St?l gives, for the male length, ineluding the tegmina, 58 mm., this dimension being, for the female before us, only 51 mm. Such decided size variation has, however, been reenrded for other species of Salomona. The general coloration is clay color, the mandibles and spines black, the tegmina with numerous very small flecks of blackish brown. The antennae have the first two joints dlay color, the others chestnut-brown, solidly so distad, but in greater portion with intersections between the joints dlay color. The ovipositor is much as in S. nigripes here described. The vertex is exactly as in 8.maculifrons St?l, its fastigium short, straight, acute conical, strongly ascendant, dorsad with a small tubercle at its base and with cephalic surface somewhat swollen. The structure is slightly more robust, with head broader than- in that species; the face and genae much less deeply impresso-punctate, best described as thickly covered with shallow but large impressed puncta. The ovipositor differs from that of maculifrons in not tapering as markedly distad to the apex, which is distinctly less acute. Had it been included, the species would have been placed in a different section of Redtenbacher's, Brongniart's and Karny's keys to the genus from maculifrons, due to the facial sculpture. Never- theless, it is clear that these species are more closely related to each other than to the other species of Salomona here discussed.

We agree with Kirby, who examined Walker's type of Lesina lutescens, an immature male, in considering these species congeneric. We do not believe, however, that blanchardi Brongniart75 is gener- ically distinct (as did Kirby) and in consequence we place Eume- galodon Brongniart, proposed for the preoccupied Megalodon, in synonymy under Lesina. In fact it appears probable that lutescens will be found a synonym of ensifer. Karny doubted Kirby's assignment of Lesina and in consequence retained the name Eumegalodon.

Here we find an array of species, some of which are extremely plastic and many of which are exceedingly close in relationship. The treatment by Redtenbacher in his "Monographie der Conocephalidarum" is superficial, dogmatic and confusing. The work of several earlier authors was ignored and a multitude of species described, the validity of many being more than doubtfuL Even the characters used are in many cases of questionable value, particularly those of coloration. It is much to be regretted that Karny, in his "Revisio Cono- cephalidarum," made no effort to clear up the numerous Redten- bacherian errors. Though insufficient material of Euconocephalus </text>

In that genus we were able to determine, from thorough study of the North American forms found north of Mexico, based on ample series, that a multitude of synonyms existed and that the range of variation in the widely distributed and very plastic species was a feature of the greatest importance, unknown or ignored by both Redtenbacher and Karny. In the material of Euconocephalus, now under consideration, eight species appear to be recognizable. For these we have chosen the apparently best fitting names from the long list and have been able to assign to synonymy a number of the names there found. It is to be hoped that more truly revisionary work will be under- taken and, should this be done, we are satisfied that the number of species of Euconocephalus, placed at thirty-eight by Karny in the "Genera Insectorum" (1912), will show very great reduction.

Comparison of the present material, as well as a large series of this species from Japan, the Loo Choo and Bonin Islands, with a series, recognized by us as referable to E. pallidus (Redtenbacher) and so recorded in the present paper, shows that the latter insect is ex- ceedingly close in relationship. The phylum under consideration is clearly subject to great specific individual variation and the nomenelature is in a chaotic state. For the present, we believe varius to be separable from pallidus by the average slightly greater fastigial length (though often the same in individuals of the two), by the proportionately shorter caudal femora and average decidedly shorter ovipositor, which very rarely exceeds the caudal femur in length and is usually dis- tinetly shorter.

Batu Sangkar, Padangische Bovenland, Sumatra, August and September, 1901, (Harrison and Hiller), 1 c, (brown), [A. N. S. P.]. Careful comparison of this series with material of C. varius (Walker) shows these species to be very nearly related, as discussed under that species. In Redtenbacher's key, pallidus is separated from thunbergi St?l (= varius) by its more slender form and more nearly acuminate tegminal apices. These features are shown, by the material at hand, to be worthless. From the localities given in the original deseription and the final comments there made, we believe that more than one species may be ineluded, the data on the immature female from the Philippines indicating that that specimen is probably referable to varius as recognized by us. As a result, it is probable that a single type must be seleeted for pallidus, before that name can be stabilized.

          <text>244 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Vol. LXXIVThe presence of a series of maculatus from the Province of Kwang- Tung, China, in a recently received collection, indicates that this is probably the most abundant species of Conocephalus in that region. As Walker's deseription agrees in all respects with this material we feel justified in indicating the above synonymy. Mount Banahao, Luzon, Philippine Islands, (from C. F. Baker), 1 9.

In addition to the suffused and interrupted brown band between the median and ulnar veins of the tegmina, this species is distinctive in having the limbs thickly supplied with flecks of mummy brown. The tegmina are not heavily marked in any of the present series, the specimens from Mount Makiling being so recessive that the tegminal suffusions are weakly defined. All are macropterous, with tegmina extending slightly beyond the apices of the caudal femora. Conocephalus (Xiphidion) laetus (Redtenbacher) 1891. Xiphidium laetum Redtenbacher, Verh. Zool-bot. Ges.

The Philippine material differs from the original description in lacking the dorsal brown stripe of head and pronotum, the Moluccan pair in being decidedly larger. These specimens agree so closely in all other features that we feel fully justified in considering them conspecific. We note the following features, not mentioned by Redtenbacher. The antennae appear closely and minutely subannulate, rather than "remote fusco-annulatae." The ovipositor shows a very faintly sigmoid tendency and is broader than normal in the genus; thus of the same type as in the Japanese C. gladiatus (Redten- bacher), but much less elongate.

This insect appears to be very close to C. laetus (Redtenbacher), differing in the much shortened organs of flight and dark genicular areas of the caudal femora. In the specimen here recorded the caudal femora have the genicular areas tipped with a suffusion of brown, rather than " apicel extremo nigro-nitido." The male stridulating area is proportionately smaller and less elongate than in males of laetus before us, while the caudal tibiae have the dorso-internal spur conspicuous and decidedly larger than any of the dorso-internal spines. So close does it agree in other respects with laetus, that, were these features not of decided diagnostic value, we would have considered it a brachypterous example of that species. The very narrow convex callosity of the pronotal lateral lobes in this species and laetus is slightly narrower than in the related C. gladiatus (Redtenbacher).

          <text>248 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Vol. LXXIVThough apparently belonging near C. melas (Haan), the species has been referred by Karny to Conocephalus in its most limited sense (the subgenus Conocephalus as recognized by us), due to the absence of prosternal spines. We find that the prosternal spines are well developed in melas (as is normal in the subgenus Xiphidion), much smaller in C. formosus (Redtenbacher) and reduced to mere tuberculations at the latero-caudal angles of the prosternum in vestitus. As a result we do not believe this character can be given higher than specific diagnostic significance in the present case and that the subgenus Xiphidion will f?ll as a synonym of the subgenus Conocephalus, unless other charaeters exist to warrant its separation. Further study, however, we believe necessary before final action can be taken. LISTROSCELINAE Karny has recently described a genus, Cecidophaga,86 related to the genera discussed below and which, in our opinion, should unhesitatingly be referred to the Listroscelinae. He has again dogmatically followed the assignments of Brunner and is confused by the fact that that author placed Teratura in the Conocephalinae (as at present understood), but the genus Xiphidiopsis in the Listroscelinae. This is one of the major reasons why Karny feels unable to assign Cecidophaga to a definite subfamily. We feel certain that Teratura and Xiphidiopsis are related genera of the Listroscelinae. The spines of the cephalic tibiae are not unusually elongate in certain species of these genera, a character separating most of the Listroscelinae from other sub- families. The general structure, however, shows such decided similarity to that of species of other unquestioned Listroscelids, that to separate them from that subfamily would be a violation of common sense. In fact both types of spination can be found in different species of the genus Xiphidiopsis itself. Having modified the characterization of the Listroscelinae to cover the genera Teratura, Xiphidiopsis, Cecidophaga and Lipo- tactes, little of the confusion encountered by recent workers remains. To do this admittedly weakens the distinction between the related subfamilies, but it is our experience that, as the species of the World become better known, the impossibility of separating86 Treubia, I, p. 292, (1921). </text>

ALLOTERATURA new genus This genus is ereeted to inelude two Philippine species recently described by Karny as members of the genus Teratura and three new species here described. It is apparently closely related to Teratura, differing strikingly in the extremely short, conical last segment of the maxillary palpi.87 We cannot follow Redtenbacher and Karny in placing these genera in the subfamily Conocephalinae as now understood. The very close agreement in general structure with the genus Xiphidi- opsis offers convincing proof that they should instead be referred to the Listroscelinae. Though members of that subfamily, they are aberrant in having the tibiae armed with shorter spines than in any of the other genera there included. GENOTYPE.-Alloteratura mindanao new species. Vertex shorter and narrower than first antennal joint, narrowly triangular with bluntly rounded apex, the dorsal surface longi- tudinally very weakly suleate or subsuleate. Maxillary palpi very elongate but with last joint very short, broader than long, strongly conical. Pronotum much as in Xiphidiopsis, strongly produced caudad with margin there convex, dorsal surface weakly convex, lateral lobes with humeral sinus very weak to decided. Lateral foramen of thorax largely concealed in males, visible from latero-caudal point in females but never large and fully exposed as in Xiphidiopsis. Tegmina and wings fully developed to moderately reduced; stridulating field of male tegmina covered by production caudad of pronotum. Prosternum unarmed. Male genitalia showing very great specific differentiation, ultimate tergite produced with caudal margin concave. High specialization often found in a large plate above the subgenital plate and between the cerci, which is developed from the ultimate tergite ventro-distad on each side; thus the ultimate tergite forms a sort of yoke, a development previously unknown to us. Female with genitalia much as in Xiphidiopsis; cerci showing some swelling meso-distad; ovipositor curving gently dorsad, with margins unarmed. Cephalic coxae armed with a long spine. Femora unarmed, genicular lobes rounded (except in sandakanae, in which species those of the caudal femora are unispinose). Cephalic tibiae with apert auditory fora- mina, the ventral margins armed with four internal and three or four external, relatively short spines (the longest one and one-half87 These organs were not described or figured by Redtenbacher, but are shown by Karny's figure to be of the normal elongate type in the genotype, T. monstrosa Redtenbacher (Gen.

Caudal tibiae with three pairs of short distal spurs; ventral margins supplied with numerous short and heavy spines, dorsal margins supplied distad with a few very small and slender spines. In addition to the three new species here deseribed, we assign to the present genus the two Philippine species xiphidiopsis and simplex, recently described by Karny as members of the genus Teratura.88 It is very possible that the Japanese Teratura suzuki Matsumura and Shiraki belongs neither to that or the present genus, but to the genus Xiphidiopsis. Alloteratura penangica new species. Plate XIX, figures 1, 2 and 3. From the other known species of the genus the present may be distinguished by its smaller size, pronotum with humeral sinus very weak and reduction in the organs of flight. The male before us differs further, from the known males of other species, in the distinetive but much less highly specialized genitalia. TYPE: o; Island of Penang, British Straits Settlements. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 820.] In addition to the features given in the generic description, the following are diagnostic for this species. Size small, form slender. Vertex very weakly suleate. Pronotum showing somewhat less convexity than in A. xiphidiopsis (Karny). Lateral lobes of pronotum shallow, with ventro-cephalic angle very weakly in- dicated, the margin convex to the ventral angle, which is broadly rounded at more than ninety degrees, caudal margin strongly oblique, straight except at humeral sinus where it is broadly and shallowly concave. Tegmina and wings showing considerable reduction, narrowed and nearly reaching apices of caudal femora. Ultimate tergite produced, embracing cercal bases, caudal margin weakly concave laterad to these and weakly coneave above these, deeply concave between these. Cerci small and simple, moder- ately stout proximad with a short dorso-internal lamella, thence tapering and curving inward, then straight to the acute apex, the external margin curving to the straight internal margin to form this. Above the subgenital plate is seen a thick trapezoidal plate, extending caudad an equal distance (the yoke portion of the ul- timate tergite).

Though instantly recognizable by the distinctive male genitalia, this sex of the present species agrees very closely in other respects with a male of A. xiphidiopsis (Karny) before us. In the present male the only other differences are seen to lie in the broader, blunter vertex which is less distinetly sulcate, the less ample pro- notum with proportionately slightly shorter lateral lobes and the antennae which show no trace of annulation. TYPE: di; Dapitan, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 821.] The following characters are considered diagnostic for this species, in addition to those noted in the generic description. Size and form medium for the genus. Vertex broader and blunter than in A. xtphidiopsis, flattened dorsad and showing a linear subsul- cation. Pronotum very slightly less convex than in A. xiphidiopsis. Lateral lobes of pronotum with ventro-cephalic and ventro-caudal angles weakly indicated by broad convexities, the latter weakest ventral angle rounded at ninety degrees, caudal margin with humeral sinus deep, rounded obtuse-angulate. Tegmina and wings fully developed. Ultimate tergite moderately produced, its distal margin showing on each side two weak convexities, between which it is dorsad broadly and weakly concave. Cerci very heavy, swollen and irregular in contour, proximal three-fifths nearly as broad as long, lamellate dorsad and swollen in ventral portion, thence the cerci are cylindrical, produced dorsad, slanting inward, scarcely tapering in proximal half, weakly tapering in distal half to the rounded and attingent apices. Mesad between the cerci the yoke of the ultimate tergite projects caudad considerably beyond the subgenital plate, its angulate apex is hooded with dorsal surface medio-longitudinally sulcate, the ventral surface deplanate. Subgenital plate with lateral margins broadly convex-convergent to the narrowly truncate apex; the surface, on each side, just before the apex, raised and bearing a small, weakly decurved style, dis- tinetly less than three times as long as its greatest width.

Genicular lobes of cephalic and me- dian femora bluntly rounded, of caudal femora each with a single heavy spine. Tibial spines as normal in the genus.89 General coloration dlay color. Eyes dark brown. Antennae chestnut brown, heavily overlaid with black proximad, this be- coming less extensive distad and only occupying the intersections of the joints. Vertex and occiput blackish brown, this continued as a dorsal suffusion of chestnut brown on the disk of the pronotum. Wings suffused with brown. Ovipositor tawny. The type measurements are given first. Length of body 11 and 12.5, length of pronotum 3.5 and 3.9, total width of pronotum 2.3 and 2.5, length of lateral lobe of pronotum 2 and 2.1, depth of lateral lobe of pronotum 1.8 and 1.9, length of tegmen 17.6 and 18.7, width of tegmen 2.3 and 2.6, length of cephalic femur 3.3 and 4, length of caudal femur 10.5 and 11.7, length of ovipositor 8.8 and 9.8 mm. In addition to the type, a female paratype, bearing the same data, is before us. XIPHMIOPSIS Redtenbacher GENOTYPE, selected by Kirby in 1906, X. fallax Redtenbacher. We here restrict this genus to the species having the auditory foramina of the cephalic tibiae apert on both faces.89 Except that, in the type, only one -of the ventro-external margins of the median tibiae bears six (and one distal) spines. </text>

          <text>254 PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACADEMY OF [Vol. LXXIVAs in Alloteratura, a single species is before us which has the genicular lobes of the caudal femora unispinose. Redtenbacher and Karny's characterization of the genus must, therefore, be modified in this respect. The subgenital plate in the female sex shows great specific differences. The cephalic coxae are armed with a spine in all of the species before us except the aberrant gemmicula and aglaia here described. In the species before us the longest cephalic tibial spines exceed the width of the tibia at their bases by one and one-half to slightly over four times. Xiphidiopsis dicera new species. Plate XIX, figures 10, 11 and 12. This insect is distinguished in both sexes by the darkened and rounded tips of the genicular lobes of the caudal femora. In the male, the ultimate tergite is produced mesad in a small two-horned process, the cerci are flattened, weakly incurved, with a blunt dorso-internal projection proximad. In the female, the subgenital plate is of the same type as found in X. lita Hebard (described as probably adventive in Hawaii), but the triangularly produced median portion is more ample, with apex more acute. The cephalic tibial spines are longer than in any other species before us, those of the males being somewhat longer than those of the females at hand. TYPE: d; Singapore, British Straits Settlements. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 824.] Size rather small for the genus, form slender: Vertex showing a subobsolete linear sulcation. Last j?int of maxillary palpus equal in length to fourth, enlarging suddenly near the transverse, truncate apex. Pronotum elongate, with dorsal surface very feebly convex, the metazona produced caudad and equal in length to the prozona; cephalic margin of lateral lobes with ventro- cephalic angle rounded and broadly obtuse-angulate, margin ven- trad more strongly rounded, caudal margin weakly concave at humeral sinus and slightly more decidedly concave opposite the very large, apert, thoracic foramen. Tegmina and wings fully developed. Ultimate tergite moderately produced, its caudal margin shallowly concave between cercal bases, its surface mesad raised and produced caudad in a pair of cylindrical projections, each slightly over twice as long as its basal width, which diverge and form a right-angle between their bases.

Subgenital plate very small, with a median transverse ridge, beyond this with lateral margins straight and parallel to the slightly de- curved styles, each of which is nearly four times as long as itsbasal width, separated by a distance slightly greater than the length of one of these, the subgenital plate briefly produced between these and strongly transverse, trapezoidal. Cephalic coxae armed. Genicular lobes of all femora bluntly rounded. Cephalic tibiae very slender, except at the auditory foramina, which portion is decidedly swollen, ventral margins armed with four pairs and one external (or rarely five pairs) of elongate spines and with a distal pair of minute spines. These spines are unusually long for the genus, the longest slightly over four times the width of the tibia at that point. Median tibiae ventrad with five pairs of shorter spines and with a minute pair of distal spines; thickened in proximal two-thirds, decidedly more slender in distal third. Caudal tibiae armed as described for Alloteratura on page 250. ALLOTYPE: 9; Island of Penang, British Straits Settlements. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection.] Agrees closely with male, differing as follows. Size very slightly larger. Production of pronotum decidedly shorter, the metazona two-thirds as long as the prozona; lateral lobes with concavity of caudal margin opposite thoracic foramen less than at humeral sinus. Supra-anal plate small, subtriangular with apex very broadly round - ed, impressed meso-proximad. Cerci cylindrical, widest meso-proxi- mad, thence tapering to their acute apices, slightly incurved and hardly three times as long as greatest width. Ovipositor elongate, swollen proximad, distal portion curved very weakly dorsad with margins unarmed; dorsal valves acute at apex, ventral valves with a very faint concavity of ventral margin just before apex, with apex itself rounded and decurved. Subgenital plate of the same type as in lita, differing in being supplied with stiff hairs, while the produced, triangular, median portion is much larger, leaving only brief convex lateral portions, the produced portion only half as long as its basal width, with apex sharply rounded. General coloration pale yellowish brown, probably immaculate light green in life. The genicular lobes of the caudal femora are tipped with blackish brown, this apparently of specific diagnostic importance. The intersection of the antennal segments are weakly embrowned to different degrees. The tegmina show the sutural margin faintly tinged with brown, as are the areolae toward that margin.

Xiphidiopsis cryptosticta new species. Plate XIX, figure 13. This species has the tegmina marked faintly with suffused spots of brown, the genicular lobes of the cephalic and caudal femora suffused distad with brown, the latter unispinose. In the female sex, which alone is known, the subgenital plate is broad, the disto-lateral portions with margin broadly convex and the median portion with distal margin coneave. This is a very different type from that developed in X. lita Hebard and X. dicera deseribed above. It is a much more simple development of the type found in the very distinct X. drepanophora described below. TYPE: 9; Singapore, British Straits Settlements. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 826.] Compared with the female sex of dicera, the present inseet is found to show the following diagnostic charaeters. Size medium, form slender. Vertex showing a weak suleation, which in basal portion broadens into a shallow depression. Last joint of maxil- lary palpus equal in length to fourth. Pronotum with metazonal portion about two-thirds as long as prozonal portion; lateral lobes with margin curving evenly to ventral angle, which is more strongly rounded, concavities of caudal margin opposite humeral sinus and thoracic foramen very weak and of equal degree. Supra-anal plate small, shield-shaped, with apex rounded and dorsal surface weakly concave. Cerci of same type as in dicera but more elongate, nearly four times as long as greatest width, with apical portion very slender. Ovipositor as in dicera, except that the distal extremity of the ventral valves is even more weakly specialized. Subgenital plate distinetive; not narrowing to the distal extremity, latero-distad with margins broadly convex, mesad with distal margin concave; surface transversely shallowly concave meso-proximad and shal- lowly concave in disto-lateral portions. Limbs more elongate than in dicera. Genicular lobes of cephalic and median femora bluntly rounded, of caudal femora unispinose. Cephalic tibiae armed with the same number of spines as in dicera, these, however, much shorter, the longest slightly over twice (in one paratype varying to slightly over three times) the tibial width at that point. Median tibiae as in dicera, except that the internal of the proximal pair of spines is often missing. </text>

This is the first species of the present genus known to us which, in the male sex, has the ultimate tergite produced latero-ventrad into a specialized projection between the cerci, thus forming a sort of yoke. The genitalia for both sexes are highly distinetive. TYPE: d; Kolambugan, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.)

Limbs and their armament much as in cryptosticta, except that the genicular lobes of all the femora are bluntly rounded. Longest spine of cephalie tibiae slightly over twice the tibial width at that point. ALLOTYPE: 9; Dapitan, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection.] Agrees closely with male, differing as follows. Production of pronotum caudad decidedly shorter, the metazona three-quarters as long as the prozona. Supra-anal plate and cerci much as in cryptosticta. Ovipositor more elongate than in that species, the apex of the ventral valves much as in dicera. Subgenital plate medio-longitudinally subearinate, distal third broadly angulate emarginate with margins of this emargination feebly concave,9 the lateral angles thus formed nearly as long as their basal width, their apices sharply rounded and forming an angle of slightly less than ninety degrees. General coloration light yellowish brown, green distad on organs of flight and caudal limbs; in life light green. Genicular lobes of cephalic and caudal femora suffused distad with dark brown, this narrowly margining the dorso-distal extremity of these members as well, though there very weak on the cephalie femora. Antennae and tegmina marked as in cryptostosticta. The males have a dark brown suffusion on each tegmen at the caudal extremity of the stridulating area.

Plate XV, figure 10; plate XX, figures 5, 6 and 7. This and the following species differ strikingly from the other forms of the genus before us in their smaller size, more slender form, more delicate structure, more contrasting coloration, absence of a cephalic coxal spine and very high specialization of the male supra-anal plate and cerci. Though representing a distinct group, we do not believe that they should be separated generically. TYPE: d; Surigao, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.) [Hebard Collection, Type No. 827.] Size small and form slender for the genus. Vertex with sulcation almost obsolete. Maxillary palpi with last joint equal in length to fourth. Pronotum elongate and slender, the metazona produced caudad and almost as long as the prozona, its surface as convex as in X. drepanophora here described. Lateral lobes of pronotum shallow, the ventro-cephalic angle broadly rounded, the ventral angle less broadly so, the caudal margin strongly oblique with concavity at humeral sinus very weak, but that opposite thoracic foramen decided. Ultimate tergite roundly produced on each side to bases of cerci, deeply and extensively U-emarginate mesad to near base. This emargination is filled by the supra-anal plate which there is flattened, longitudinally weakly bi-suleate and directed caudad and weakly ventrad; beyond this it is directed ventrad, in a narrower shaft with proximo-lateral margins lamel- late, which, opposite the apex of the subgenital plate, is expanded into a large, rounded apex with ventral surface flattened but convex me-ad, bounded laterad and proximad by high sub-lamellate ridges, which are separated from the median portion by a deep channel. Cercus very large, very highly specialized, proximal section large and globose, about as broad as long, connected with distal portion by a short, thick neck; distal portion produced ventrad in a very large and delicate lamellate plate, directed mesad, with surface in an oblique plane (the cercal plates so large that they overlap strongly); distal portion produced dorsad in a heavy ridge, directed mesad at a sharp angle, the disto-internal portion (or true apex) separated from the ventral plate, directed dorsad, with immediate apex roundly acute-angulate produced and bearing at its caudal base a flattened vertical lobe with outline strongly convex. Above the subgenital plate the yoke of the ultimate tergite is produced as a very similarly shaped plate, but with free margins lamellate, bearing in homologous position to the styles, two processes of the same slenderness but longer, directed ventrad and then curved distad.

Cephalic tibiae with four pairs of spines and a distal pair of very small spines, the longest spine nearly three times the tibial width at that point. Median tibiae as described here for X. dicera, except that the proximo-external spine is absent on both and the penultimate- internal spine is absent on one of these. Caudal tibiae armed as characteristic of this and the genus Alloteratura. ALLOTYPE: 9; Butuan, Mindanao, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Baker.)

Supra-anal plate much as here described for dicera, but with apex less broadly rounded. Cerci cylindrical, widest meso-proximad, thence tapering to the elongate, slender apices, slightly incurved and slightly over four times as long as greatest width. Ovipositor elongate, swollen in proximal third, distal portion showing a faint curvature dorsad with margins unarmed; dorsal valves acute at apex, ventral valves with acute apices slightly decurved. Sub- genital plate subquadrate, lateral margins rounding broadly into the transverse distal margin, which in caudal aspect is broadly concave. General coloration yellowish buff, the tegmina delicate yellowish green. Antennae with intersection of the joints embrowned, at frequent intervals these markings being much heavier and forming blackish brown annuli. Vertex blackish brown, this paling on the occiput to a chestnut suffusion. Pronotum with a medio-longi- tudinal dark suffusion, chestnut cephalad, zinc orange mesad, then with an elongate triangular area of chestnut caudad, with the narrow, dark, cingulate caudal margin enelosing a small triangular patch of buffy.

Agreeing closely with the male of X. gemmicula, here deseribed, in general structure and color pattern, the present male differs in certain color features, but signally in the remarkable and distinet- ive genitalic specialization. TYPE: c; Island of Basilan, Zamboanga Province, Philippine Islands. (From C. F. Raker.) [Hebard Collection, Type no. 828.] Agrees closely with gemmicula in all structural features except the following. Vertex with a delicate, linear, medio-longitudinal sulcus. Pronotum with metazona slightly shorter than prozona. Ultimate tergite and supra-anal plate similar, except that the latter is more slender, with median shaft decidedly more elongate, this portion with dorsal surface channeled, the distal portion similar but less heavy, so that the apex has its median portion narrow, vertical but convex, with the lateral ridge reduced to a small, flattened lobe dorsad on each side, with outline strongly convex, these directed dorso-laterad. Cercus very large and intricately specialized, proximal portion heavy, short, produced internally in a heavy sub-denticulate plate; from this portion a much more slender shaft is directed caudad, developing distad as follows. Dorsad produced in a stout finger which is widest just before its rounded apex, ventrad produced as a very large and heavy plate, directed mesad with ventral surface deeply concave, forming an auriform process (so that these portions of the cerci overlap strongly). Above the subgenital plate the yoke of the ultimate tergite is produced, bearing two slender processes directed dorsad, which are concealed by the proximo-internal plates of the cerci. Subgenital plate very similar to that of gemmicula, except that it is somewhat shorter and the styles are not over three times as long as their basal width. General coloration (apparently discolored) buffy brown, the sides of the thorax yellow and probably striking in life. Antennae as in gemmicula. Vertex tipped with blackish brown, remaining por- tions and a medio-longitudinal suffusion on occiput and pro- notum of zinc orange, this, toward the caudal margin of the pro- notum, changing to a small, elongate, triangular patch of buffy, bordered by a suffusion of blackish brown. This conspicuous marking, though of the same general character as in gemmicula, is seen to be differently proportioned. Tegmina very similar to those of gemmicula, but more embrowned, with a regular series of eleven, instead of ten, similar spots and one or two similar spots distad between the median vein and its branch. Limbs as in gemmicula except that the penultimate joint of the tarsi and the apices of the caudal tibiae are more heavily embrowned. Length of body 13, length of pronotum 3.7, greatest width of pronotum 1.7, length of pronotal lateral lobe 2.8, depth of pronotal lateral lobe 1.4, length of tegmen 15.9, width of tegmen 1.9, length of cephalic femur 4, length of caudal femur 9.3 mm.

We propose the present genus to include the two species, pre- viously assigned to the genus Xiphidiopsis, which have the external auditory foramen of the cephalie tibiae apert, but the internal very strongly conchate; distincta (Redtenbacher) and teuthroides (Bolivar). GENOTYPE.-Euanisous teuthroides (Bolivar). The larger size and heavier build of teuthroides, when compared with the species of Xiphidiopsis before us, gives it a somewhat stronger, though wholly superficial, resemblance to a very di- minutive and slender Gryllaerid. Euanisous teuthroides (Bolivar) 1904. Xiphidiopsis teuthroides Bolivar, Ann. Mus. Nat. Hungarici, II, p. 391. [c7; Singapore, [British Straits Settlements].] Labuan, British North Borneo, 1 9. Singapore, British Straits Settlements, (from C. F. Baker), 1 i1 9. In addition to the charaeters given by Bolivar, the following are noted. Vertex not suleate. Distal joint of maxillary palpus distinetly longer than fourth. Cephalie coxae armed with a strong spine. The topotypic female before us shows the following additional features of value. Ovipositor elongate, very faintly eurved upward, margins unarmed, ventral valves subemarginate near the blunt and weakly deflexed apex, (as in Xiphidiopsis). Ovipositor with ventral valves, on each side at base, produced in a short, narrow, horizontal. rounded lamella.93 Subgenital plate apparently not strongly chitinous and transversely truncate distad. The caudal tibiae, though described by Bolivar as unarmed, are in the topotypic material before us armed dorsad with small spines and ventrad, except in proximal portion, with slightly larger spines, distad with three pairs of spurs. The male before us agrees so closely in every other detail with Bolivar's description that we are convinced "femora" instead of "tibiae" was intended. Thus distincta appears to be separable mainly by its smaller size, un- armed mesosternum and by male genitalic differences.92 In allusion to the remarkably, but very differently, developed auditory foramina on the internal and external surfaces of the cephalic femora. 91 The Labuan female has this lamella decidedlv broader, and, though appar- ently agreeing in all other features (the contour of the subgenital plate can not be accurately distinguished), males fr?m Borneo may show that insect to be specifically distinet. </text>

Phlugis thaumasia new species. Plate XXI, figures 2, 3 and 4. This insect agrees in every feature of generic importance with the American genotype, P. teres (DeGeer).9 It is the second Malayan species to be described of this otherwise Neotropical genus. Known from a single male, the specimen is found to agree closely with the single known female of the other Malayan species, P. dubia (Karny), described from Banguey Island, British North Borneo. It is distinguished by the wholly unarmed caudal femora. We believe that the male sex of the Bornean insect will show distinctive genitalic differences. These species may be quickly separated from other Asiatic Listroscelids by the prominent eyes, which are produced cephalad, the short, declivent and non-projecting vertex, the large curved spine of the cephalic coxae and distinctive limb armament.

The remarkable spatulate development of the spines of the cephalic limbs is well figured by Carl. These spines have their ventral surfaces concave and supplied with numerous microscopic black spinulae. Carl has apparently (unlike most other authors) counted the distal pair of minute spines in giving the count for the cephalic and median tibiae. In the specimen here recorded the cephalic tibiae bear ventrad six pairs of very elongate, specialized spines and a pair of minute distal spines. The median tibiae have ventrad six external and five internal moderately elongate, slender spines and a minute distal pair of spines. In this specimen we note further that the median trochanters are armed ventrad with a single small spine, the ovipositor has its margins minutely serrulate distad and the subgenital plate is minutely but suddenly concave-emarginate at its apex.

The above synonymy is wholly due to Brunner having assigned his genus to the Listroscelinae, while, when Griffini submitted his specimen, it was referred by Karny, Redtenbacher and Werner to the Tympanophorinae. It appears almost certain that the latter subfamily, based primarily on the absence of a dorso-internal spur on the caudal tibiae is of no value. The much lower significance of such differentiation is well understood if it is noted that the North American subgenera of Conocephalus, for instance, are in a number of cases thereby separable,96 Lipotactes maculatus new species. Plate XV, figure 12. This remarkable insect is readily distinguished from the Bornean genotype, L. alienus Brunner and the Sumatran L. karnyi (Grif- fini) by its much smaller size and varied coloration. It is odd that, though three species are now known, a male of the genus has as yet not been described.96 See Rehn and Hebard, Trans. Am. Ent. Soc., XLI, p. 226, (1915). </text>

In the present material the Moluccan males have the tegmina averaging broader and tapering more rapidly distad than in the Malayan males.

Redten- bacher and Karny have misidentified material of mundus as annulicornis, this apparently resulting in Kirby's placing the latter name in the present synonymy. In the Malayan material before us the last two tarsal joints are alone blackish, while in the Moluccan series the majority have all of the tarsal joints blackish. The present large series, however, shows this feature to be of no diagnostic value, a few Moluccan individuals having only the last two joints dark, while a single male of that series has the tarsi entirely pale, (these specimens belonging to the same species beyond possible question). The color of the cephalic tibiae varies similarly, the majority of the Moluccan series having heavy dark brown flecks at the bases of the spines, a few intensive specimens have the external surface of the tibiae solidly dark brown to near their apices, while a few re- cessive examples have the tibiae with scarcely a trace of brown marking. In the charaeter of the presenrce of one or two dorsal spines on the median tibiae, even greater variation occurs, as in some in- dividuals before us such spines are absent on one side and present on the other. Likewise the form of the male tegminal speculum varies to some extent. EUHEIXACENTRUS new genus. The present genus is erected to inelude a single species, E. an- nulicornis (St?l). That species has apparently not been reported since the original description, Redtenbacher and Karny having mistaken Hexacentrus mundus (Walker) for it. The limb armament and short, serrulate ovipositor are among the most important features to separate Euhexacentrus from Hexa- centrus. Closer agreement in certain features is shown by the Papuan Parahexacentrus paradoxus (Karny). Compared with unicolor Serville, genotype of Hexacentrus and other species of that genus before us, the present genus is found to differ as follows. Vertex similar, except that it shows a decided, though linear, medio-longitudinal suleus. Pronotum with trans- verse sulci deeper and ventral margin of lateral lobes more lamellate and sinuous. Tegmina and wings showing reduction, as in H. japonicus (Karny), the latter differing in having the rounded apex nearer the costal than the suturalmargin.

Lack of material for comparison has apparently led Redten- bacher, Kirby and Karny, into the error of placing annulicornis as a synonym of the very distinct Hexacentrus mundus (Walker). This species was originally very poorly charaeterized and we note the following features, in consequence, in addition to those given in the accompanying generic description, for the female sex. Size small for the group. Maxillary palpi with fifth (distal) joint slightly longer than fourth. Subgenital plate slightly longer than broad, with lateral margins convergent and feebly convex to the very weakly bilobate, truncate apex. Femoral genicular lobes with cephalic external bluntly triangularly produced; cep- halic internal, those of median femora and caudal internal strongly unispinose; caucal external strongly bispinose. General coloration yellowish bufl. Dorsal surface of vertex dark brown. Antennae with frequent elongate annuli of blackish brown. Pronotum with disk suffused with brown, the cephalic and caudal margins there narrowly blackish brown; lateral lobes with a dot of blackish brown mesad on ventral margin. Sides of thorax with a similar dot above insertion of median limbs. Teg- mina pale greenish or green yellow; veinlets, but not veins, delicate vinaceous; a meso-proximal and meso-distal fleck of brown and a series of small flecks along the sutural margin. In the more in- tensive specimen, a series of as decided but smaller flecks also occur along the costal margin. Genicular spines of all femora blackish brown, the genicular area lined ventrad with that color. Limbs with the following blackish brown dots. Cephalic femora mesad with a dorsal, median and ventral dot and distad a median98 Though the median tibiae are usually supplied with one or two dorsal spines in Hexacentrus, we have found that presence or absence of such is an individual variation in species of that genus. </text>

[Hebard Col- lection, Type no. 844.] Size large, form elongate. Vertex with fastigium narrow, curving ventrad and not projecting beyond plane of face; dorsal surface longitudinally suleate, cephalic surface narrow and convex, sep- arated a brief distance from frontal fastigium. Eyes round, pro- jecting, bead-like. Pronotum feebly sellate, transverse sulci weak, caudal portion of metazona slightly elevated, flattened, its surface wrinkeled like other portions of disk but not as shining, due to its being mieroscopically rugulose as well; lateral lobes longer than deep, ventral margin very broadly convex, humeral sinus broadly concave. Tegmina and wings fully developed, extending to apex of the very long ovipositor, the former narrow. Cerci cultriform, due to a moderate lammellation of the internal margin, weakly incurved. Ovipositor slender, straight and very elongate, showing distad a slight curvature ventrad, the dorsal margin showing a weak, roughened channel toward the acute apex. Subgenital plate scoop-shaped, the disto -lateral margins convergent and weakly concave to the weakly produced, bluntly angulate apex. Spines of prosternum, mesosternum and metasternum heavy. Genicular lobes of eephalic and median femora bispinose, of caudal femora unispinose. Cephalic femora with ventral margins moderately lamellate, caudal femora slender, showing slight thickening prox- imad.

Cephalic and median tibiae armed with seven pairs of rather heavy spines. Head and pronotum honey yellow, with a broad post-ocular band of whitish on each side, which is continued to the caudal margin of the pronotum and is there, in metazonal portion, bordered with a suffusion of cinnamon brown, broad on the disk and narrow on the lateral lobes. Lateral lobes of pronotum broadly margined ventrad with whitish. Tegmina transparent pale dull green yellow, like ground glass; stridulating field with a heavy border of warm buff, margined with a suffusion of cinnamon brown, the latter continued along the sutural margin to apex; interval between discoidal and median veins embrowned distad. Body apparently light buff in life, abdomen discolored in specimen under consider- ation. Ovipositor ochraceous-buff, tinged with tawny except proximad, much darker near apex, with dorsal channel blackish. Limbs light buff, dorsal surface of caudal femora with a longi- tudinal band of blackish chestnut brown, which becomes weak distad; spines blackish; caudal tibiae with lateral faces vinaceous- russet.

Wide dissimilarity is found when compared with other Australian species of the Saginae. The head in some ways suggests the type found in certain species of the otherwise very distinct genus Salomona, belonging to the Agraeciinae. When compared, how- ever, the head is seen to differ greatly in having its width and depth nearly equal (due to the much shorter mouthparts), in the widely separated eyes, much shorter antennae, shorter and bituberculate fastigium of the vertex and almost vertical face.

Size medium for this subfamily, which ineludes very large species, form very thick-set. Occiput evenly convex to the small, straight fastigium of the vertex, which is directed cephalad and thus projeets beyond the nearly vertical plane of the broadly convex face, the surface of face rugulose, particularly ventrad.

GRYLLACRINAE Little effort appears to have been made in assigning the multitude of species of the present genus to anything like natural groups or logical sequence. The type of wing coloration would first appear to be the most useful character for sorting to groups, but further study shows that, by such sorting, species having very great struc- tural differences would be thrown together. With the few species at present under consideration, we have arranged the linear sequence on the basis of the female ovipositor.100 These are clearly variations of the same pattern, probably subject to de- cided individual diversity in the species. </text>

In the second, the ovipositor is similarly eurved dorsad, but distad tapers evenly to the sharp apex. In the third, the ovipositor is straight and shaped much as in certain Copiphorine genera; slender, but not tapering until near the acute apex. Under these groups the species showing least development of color pattern are placed first. This is admittedly a sketchy arrangement, but a beginning must be made or the affinities of the many deseribed species will become almost impossible to ascertain. Gryllacris arctata Walker. 1869.

Lateral lobes of pronotum longer than deep, ventral angles broadly rounded, ventral margin straight and slightly oblique, humeral sinus distinct. Tegmina and wings fully developed, extending well beyond apex of abdomen, the latter extending nearly three milli- meters further caudad than the former. Tegmina as broad meso- distad as mesad, apex rather strongly rounded and slightly nearer costal than sutural margin. Wings long and rather broad, not parachute-like. Eighth tergite broad. Ultimate tergite truncate produced, its surface weakly concave declivent to apex, beneath which it is armed with two uncinate spines, the apices of which projeet dorso-caudad. Beneath these are two heavier, curved spines, springing from chitinous supra-cercal plates. Cerci elongate and very slender. Beneath the cerci are heavy plates, directed mesad, with disto-cephalic angle produced in a curved spine. Sub- genital plate weakly convex, except latero-distad where it is weakly concave, supplied with large socketed styles, between which it is produced in two narrow, rounded projections which extend caudad nearly to the median portion of the styles and between which a narrow U-shaped median emargination is formed. Cephalic and median tibiae armed with the usual number of spines of average length. Caudal femora stout and short, ventral margins armed with six internal and eight external small but stout spines, which increase in size distad. Head with labrum, clypeus, face and two proximal antennal joints ochraceous-buff, shading to buckthorn brown on occiput; eyes bordered caudad with a suffusion of prouts brown, which is continued ventrad to the clypeus as a weak, subocular, vertical suffusion. Remaining portions of antennae cinnamon brown. Pronotum prouts brown with two flecks of buffy meso-laterad on disk and a similar fleck before ventro-cephalic angle of each lateral lobe, lateral lobes and caudal portion of disk fading to buffy toward margins. Tegmina with anterior field to near apex and narrow portion toward costal margin hyaline, in other portions very weakly and evenly tinted with prouts brown, veins and veinlets prouts brown. Wings hyaline showing the faintest of brown tinting, except distad in anterior field where they are very weakly tinted with prouts brown, veins prouts brown, veinlets very slender, tinged with that color.

The blackish coloration of the body, except that abdominal tergites are each broadly buffy caudad, and hyaline the tegmina and wings, with veins and veinlets dark, show close agree- ment with that insect. In structure, however, the present insect differs greatly in the very broad vertex and much more elongate ovipositor, while in size it is larger with tegmina and wings shorter. TYPE: 9; Labuan, British North Borneo. [Hebard Collection, Type no. 847.] Size small, form moderately robust for the genus. Fastigium of vertex very broad, slightly over twice as wide as the proximal antennal joint, surface cephalad flattened, lateral margins rather bluntly rounded; ventrad fusing with frontal fastigium, transverse linear sulcation being indicated only laterad. Face shining but with irregular impressed punctae and lines. Pronotum with cephalic margin of disk broadly convex, cephalic suleus broad and deep, longitudinal sulcus faintly indicated meso-caudad, caudal suleus very weak, lateral lobes with V-sulcus broad and very deep; lateral lobes somewhat longer than deep, ventral margin nearly straight, showing faint concavity meso-proximad, ventro-cephalic angle obtuse-angulate but more sharply rounded, humeral sinus small but distinct. Tegmina and wings extending slightly beyond apex of abdomen. Tegmina broadest slightly beyond median point, apex rather broadly rounded and slightly nearer costal than sutural margin. Wings very broad, moderately parachute-like. Ovipositor very elongate, slender, strongly curved at base, thence to apex weakly curved dorsad, the apex faintly enlarged with dorsal margin suddenly oblique to the sharply rounded tip.

Though running in Griffini's key for the Bornean species of Gryllacris 108 to section A, the narrow vertex and strikingly marked pronotum and limbs show dloser agreement with the Bornean G. maculipes subspecies irregularis Griffini, than with any other described forms Though irregularis is apparently subject to considerable color variation, we believe that comparison will show annulicornis to be even more widely distinet than we can at present determine from the description of that subspecies. The sharply and thickly annulate antennae, and ovipositor, which tapers evenly to its apex, constitute striking charaeters for the present species.106 Later very fully diagnosed by Griffini as G. punctipennis subspecies demp- wolffi, which name that author has placed in synonyrny under punctipennis after examination of Walker's type (Boll.

The type of this handsomely marked species is unique. Gryllacris macroxiphus new species. Plate XXII, figure 7. We have been unable to find any closely related species amohg the numerous descriptions of Melanesian and Malayan forms of the genus. Nearest agreement is apparently with the Australian G. straminea Brunner, the present insect differing in the dark pronotum, uniformly pale limbs and somewhat larger size. The male differs further from the described male of that insect in having the subgenital plate truncate, not produced. TYPE: o; Obi Island, Moluccas. [Hebard Collection, Type no. 849.] Size and form medium for the genus. Fastigium of vertex very narrow, slightly over one half width of proximal antennal joint, surface cephalad concave between the carinate lateral margins, ventrad forming with facial fastigium a transverse suture. Face shining, moderately impresso-punctulate and rugulose. Pronotum with cephalic margin of disk very weakly convex, cephalic sulcus very broad and weak, becoming subobsolete dorsad, longitudinal sulcus represented by a fine impressed line meso-caudad, caudal sulci weak, lateral lobes with V-sulcus broad and not very deep; lateral lobes decidedly longer than deep, ventral margin nearly straight, showing faint concavity meso-cephalad, ventro-cephalic angle broadly rounded, ventro-caudal angle rounded and broadly subtruncate, humeral sinus broadly and very weakly concave. Tegmina end wings fully developed, very elongate, extending far beyond apex of abdomen. Tegmina comparatively narrow, rounded distad. Ultimate tergite rounding evenly ventrad, meso- ventrad with a minute, broadly W-shaped area, this laterad with margins carinulate, mesad impressed, its surface somewhat concave; below this area the tergite is armed with two very small teeth, curving dorso-mesad, with apices nearly attingent. Cerci elongate and very slender, between which are flattened plates (the armament of which can not be seen in the single male before us). Subgenital </text>

Caudal femora moderately stout and short, ventral margins armed with (twelve to fourteen) internal and (nine to thirteen) external spines, the proximal of which, where the greater numbers are present, being very small. ALLOTYPE: 9; same data as type. [Hebard Collection.] Agrees with male, except as follows. Size very slightly larger. Ovipositor Copiphoroid, very elongate, straight, tapering at apex to an acute median point.

Nederl. overzee. bezitt., Zool., Ins., p. 219. [ci, Java.] Labuan, British North Borneo, 2 9. These specimens differ from the typical condition in having the ventral margins of all of the femora black. Agreement, in this respect only, is shown with the variety elegans Griffini.109 We do not believe racial differentiation should be recognized, though further material may prove such to be the case. The pronotum is somewhat paler laterad in the U-shaped de- pression formed by the sulci. The tegmina are translucent cameo brown, with series of areolae distad toward the lateral margins109 Ann. Mus.

Paragryflacris griffinii new species. Plate XXI, figure 11. In the male genitalia this species shows nearest agreement with the Australian P. shelfordi Griffini. The subgenital plate, however, differs widely in being shorter, entirely lacking lateral projections and in having the apex minutely triangularly emarginate mesad and obliquely truncate on each side. The head is pale, but with vertex apparently much as in shelfordi. The transverse veinlets of the tegmina are slightly but appreciably darker than the veins, particularly proximad. TYPE: cJ; Queensland, Australia. [ilebard Collection, Type no. 851.] Size and form medium. Fastigium of vertex nearly one and one-half times as broad as proximal antennal j oint, surface cephalad flattened and finely rugulose between the slender, elevated lateral carinae. Face rather thickly but not deeply impresso-punctulate and rugulose. Pronotum with cephalic margin of disk moderately convex, cephalic suleus broad but deep, caudal marginal portion of disk slightly raised, with margin itself cingulate; lateral lobes with ventro-cephalic and ventro-caudal angles rather sharply rounded rectangular, ventral margin showing weak convexity. Tegmina and wings fully developed, ample, extending well beyond apex of abdomen. Tegmina with rounded apex slightly nearer costal than sutural margin. Ultimate tergite suddenly obtuse- angulate emarginate meso-caudad, on each side with a small finger directed ventrad and curving inward, above which is a minute node armed with a minute spine, curved meso-ventrad. Within, on the surface of the impressed area there formed, are plates armed ventrad with a spine, curved dorso-laterad, on each side. Cerci moderately elongate and slender. Subgenital plate with lateral margins straight, convergent to near apex, where they are briefly parallel, the apex with a minute angulate emargination, the lateral portions of the apex with distal margins straight, oblique to the median emargination. Spines of cephalic and median femora of the usual number, rather short. Caudal femora with ventral margins armed with (five and six) internal and (four and four) external, small spines. General coloration cinnamon buff, deepening to tawny on face, clypeus, labrum, mandibles, cephalic tibiae, tarsi and briefly distad on all the femora.

The type is unique. We take pleasure in naming this interesting species in honor of Dr. Achille Griffini, specialist on the Gryl- laerinae, who, we understand, has been obliged to give up active work, due to injuries received as an Officer in the Italian Army during the World War. Papuogryllacris obiensis new species. Plate XXII, figure 8. It is interesting to find a Moluccan species of this genus, hitherto known only from New Guinea and the more adjacent islands. Of the known forms, P. ligata subspecies concoloripes GriffiDi,"' appears to be nearest, that insect differing in the more heavily impresso-punctate face, bicolored pronotum and immaculate limbs. The ovipositor of the present insect, very slender beyond base and weakly curved upward, appears to show further differentiation from the type developed in P. ligata (Brunner). TYPE: Q; Obi Island, Moluccas. [Hebard Collection, Type no. 851.] Size medium, form moderately robust. Fastigium of vertex moderately broad, but distinctly less than one and one-half times as broad, as proximal antennal joint, surface cephalad flattened between the rounded lateral margins, ventrad forming with facial fastigium a conspicuous, transverse, linear suture. Face shining, weakly impresso -punctulate. Pronotum with cephalic margin of disk weakly but distinetly convex, cephalic suleus broad but deep, as are the V-sulci of the lateral lobes; lateral lobes decidedly longer than deep, ventral margin straight, ventro-cephalic angle some- what truncate and rounded, ventro-caudal angle rounded and broadly truncate, humeral sinus broadly concave. Tegmina and wings fully developed, extending somewhat beyond apex of ab- domen. Tegmina narrowing very gradually from median point, with apex median and rather broadly rounded. Ovipositor elon- gate and extremely slender, very gently curved dorsad throughout; apical portion not enlarged, the immediate apex sharply rounded. Subgenital plate semicircular, the lateral portions swollen so that the surface is there convex. Cephalic and median tibiae armed with three pairs of moderately elongate spines, not including the small distal pair of spines. Caudal femora very stout and moder- ately short, ventral margins armed with (fourteen and sixteen) internal and (nine and ten) external spines.110 Redia, VIII, p. 306, (1912). </text>

In the present speci- men the limbs are pale brown, the cephalic and median femora suffused proximad and with a broad suffused annulus distad of dark brown. The caudal femora are heavily suffused with dark brown, so that everywhere except proximo-internally, only streaks and blotches of the paler coloration occur. The ventro-internal margins of the caudal femora are armed mesad each with two minute spines. The longest spur of the caudal tibiae about equals in length the caudal metatarsus, the latter being armed with (five) minute spines dorsad.
